1,Michael O'Sullivan,"If “Infinity War” was about failure, “Endgame” is, ironically, all about acceptance and moving on. After 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is finally, fulfillingly over. There is no post-credit scene. But oh, what a going-away party these old friends have thrown for themselves.",2019-04-23,100,washington post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/with-humor-and-heart-avengers-endgame-is-a-fitting-send-off-for-marvels-superheroes/2019/04/23/539f3890-6391-11e9-9412-daf3d2e67c6d_story.html?utm_term=.0b83f8a52ca7
2,Helen O'Hara,"A victory lap that moonwalks through the best part of the MCU back catalogue and emphasises emotion as much as action, this is an intensely satisfying piece of blockbuster filmmaking.",2019-04-23,100,empire,https://www.empireonline.com/movies/avengers-endgame/review/
3,Richard Roeper,"I’m not prepared to instantly label Avengers: Endgame as the best of the 23 Marvel Universe movies to date, but it’s a serious contender for the crown and it’s the undisputed champion when it comes to emotional punch.",2019-04-23,100,chicago sun times,https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/avengers-endgame-review-movie-marvel-richard-roeper/
4,Peter Bradshaw,"I have to admit, in all its surreal grandiosity, in all its delirious absurdity, there is a huge sugar rush of excitement to this mighty finale, finally interchanging with euphoric emotion and allowing us to say poignant farewells.",2019-04-23,100,the guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/23/avengers-endgame-review-unconquerable-brilliance-takes-marvel-to-new-heights
5,Chris Gore,Marvel has clearly saved the best for last and I cannot stress how much those fan service moments will have you cheering. I highly recommend that you see Endgame in a packed theater of fans so that you can experience the climactic ending with the energy of the crowd.,2019-04-25,95,film threat,http://filmthreat.com/reviews/avengers-endgame/
6,Laura Prudom,"Avengers: Endgame is easily the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most ambitious, emotional, and affecting film to date, somehow managing to tie up more than a decade of storytelling in a confident (and mostly coherent) climax - a hurdle that many other blockbuster franchises have stumbled over in their final runs.",2019-04-23,95,ign,https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/23/avengers-endgame-review
7,Michael Burgin,"Comic book fans know the thrill of following all your favorite characters through a multi-issue storyline that culminates in a “universe at stake” ending. Now, thanks to 21 movies in 11 years and one massive, satisfying three-hour finale, moviegoers do, too.",2019-04-30,93,paste magazine,https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/04/avengers-endgame.html
8,Brian Lowry,"Even with the interlocking nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Endgame feels like a triumph of narrative engineering -- weaving in enough callbacks to earlier movies to delight even the nerdiest patrons.",2019-05-21,90,cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/23/entertainment/avengers-endgame-review/index.html
9,Joe Morgenstern,"Succeeds at its daunting task: summing up an epic struggle with bedazzling action; with a style that progresses, apart from a few lapses, from the elegiac through the episodic to the symphonic; and with more humor, zest and feeling — the real, heartfelt stuff — than you’d dare to expect from what is, after all, an immense industrial undertaking.",2019-04-24,90,wall street journal,https://www.wsj.com/articles/avengers-endgame-review-a-marvelous-wrap-11556124677
10,Richard Lawson,"There’s a host of great performances too, from Evans’s sad and weary nonagenarianism to Johansson’s watery mettle to Brolin’s lumbering and alluring villainy.",2019-04-23,90,vanity fair,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/avengers-endgame-review
11,Alex Abad-Santos,"The most shocking thing about Avengers: Endgame is that there are several moments within this colossal movie that feel like a Marvel miracle. These are the pockets of time when what you watch on screen sends a shock of joy jumping through your skin, making your eyes go wide and watery at the spectacle.",2019-04-23,90,vox,https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/23/18512851/avengers-endgame-review-marvel-miracle

15,Moira Macdonald,"Oh yes indeed. Avengers: Endgame brought it...This film had an insanely difficult job to do — to gracefully and tidily wrap up a 22-movie Marvel Comics cycle with a cast list bigger than the Hulk, and to do so with both poignancy and hold-your-breath action — and it delivers.",2019-04-24,88,the seattle times,https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/avengers-endgame-review-big-cast-big-action-and-a-stirring-ending/
16,Brian Truitt,"If the Marvel superhero movies on the whole are your favorite band’s individual albums, Avengers: Endgame is the triple-disc greatest-hits package with the really awesome cover and a slew of familiar, comforting gems inside.",2019-04-23,88,usa today,https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/04/23/review-avengers-endgame-marvel-greatest-hits-package/3547516002/
17,David Sims,"The film earns its length not by overstuffing the frame with opulent action, but by slowing things down and basking in the charisma of its ensemble.",2019-04-23,85,the atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/avengers-endgame-review-marvel/587821/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_term=2019-04-23T22%3A03%3A12&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo
18,Tasha Robinson,"Endgame was never designed to stand on its own as a single well-crafted movie, and it was never designed to follow the MCU formula. It was designed to cap a decade of buildup around a single gigantic story.... In that sense, it’s certainly a triumph: it’s ambitious, towering, and above all, daring in its difference.",2019-04-23,84,the verge,https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4
19,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,"Endgame manages to effectively deliver reunions alongside farewells, fan service alongside the kind of storytelling which needs to occur in order for the whole billion-dollar machine to keep a’grinding, and a handful of sincere, honest-to-God surprises that make the grandeur of the whole thing feel justified.",2019-04-23,83,consequence,https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/04/film-review-avengers-endgame/
20,Charles Barnfield,"And to say that directors Joe and Anthony Russo fulfilled the promise set by last year’s blockbuster, and the 22-film MCU story arc, is a gross understatement. The directing duo has really outdone themselves with this one. It’s just that outdoing themselves comes with some consequences.",2019-04-23,83,the playlist,https://theplaylist.net/avengers-endgame-review-20190423/
21,Leah Greenblatt,"The movie largely delivers, splashing its ambitious three-hour narrative across a sprawling canvas of characters, eras, and not-quite-insurmountable challenges.",2019-04-23,83,entertainment weekly,https://ew.com/movie-reviews/2019/04/23/avengers-endgame-review/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=link&amp;utm_term=3B0E79C4-6613-11E9-816B-ECBA4744363C&amp;utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_ew
22,Simran Hans,"The final battle is giddily cathartic, but the catharsis arises from prioritising character development over plot and spectacle. This, I imagine, will be the Avengers’ legacy.",2019-04-27,80,the observer uk,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/27/avengers-endgame-film-review
23,Christopher Machell,"This is fan service elevated into an art form, transcending winking self-aggrandisement to become something of a reflection on the past eleven years, a chugging, tooting, spectacular train of a franchise, careering indefinitely forward.",2019-04-26,80,cinevue,https://cine-vue.com/2019/04/film-review-avengers-endgame.html
24,Dana Stevens,"Avengers: Endgame throws in plenty of laughs along the way. In fact, in the long stretch between its appropriately somber opening chapter and an emotionally grueling finale, it may be the most lighthearted and character-driven Marvel movie since the giddy comic entry ""Thor: Ragnarok."" Endgame consists almost entirely of the downtime scenes that were always secretly everyone’s favorite parts of these movies anyway.",2019-04-25,80,slate,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/avengers-endgame-review-marvel-movie-samuel-beckett.html
25,Stephanie Zacharek,"Avengers: Endgame isn’t a great movie, but there are flashes of greatness in it, and quite a few of them belong to Evans. His Captain America rewards us with a revelation and escapes with a secret. The best thing in Avengers: Endgame is everything he doesn’t say.",2019-04-24,80,time,http://time.com/5576817/avengers-endgame-review/

27,Joshua Rothkopf,"Endgame often pays tribute to itself, which makes it as fascinating as it is self-serious. It taps into a live wire of doomy tragedy and phoenix-like rebirth that comics do so well.",2019-04-24,80,time out,https://www.timeout.com/us/film/avengers-endgame-2019
28,Robbie Collin,"An alternative title for this one might have been Avengers: Encore, since the film knows its entire audience has been here for the long run – even beside Infinity War, Endgame would be completely impenetrable to a novice. Think of it as a kind of victory lap, in which a decade-plus of painstaking team assembly is re-run at top speed, then paid off with thermonuclear dazzle and force.",2019-04-23,80,the telegraph,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/avengers-endgame-review-galvanisingvictory-lap-blockbuster/
29,Mike Ryan,"Avengers: Endgame is, without a doubt, the most confusing and convoluted of any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, yet it’s also unbelievably satisfying – and, yes, does act as an endpoint for many major character arcs.",2019-04-23,80,uproxx,https://uproxx.com/hitfix/avengers-endgame-review/
30,Jamie Graham,"Not quite as good as Infinity War, but wears its three-hour running time with ease and rewards the fans. Part of the journey is the end, and this goes out with a bang that’ll make you whimper.",2019-04-23,80,total film,https://www.gamesradar.com/avengers-endgame-review/
31,Matt Singer,"No matter what comes next from Marvel Studios, this Avengers is a gargantuan love letter to the equally enormous mythology that Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and the rest of their collaborators built — and to the generations of readers and moviegoers who truly believe in it.",2019-04-23,80,screencrush,https://screencrush.com/avengers-endgame-review/
32,Peter Rainer,"Best of all is Robert Downey Jr. Amid all the hardware, he alone in the Marvel series has consistently given top-notch performances. His work in “Endgame” is extraordinarily moving and makes me wish yet again that this great actor would on occasion see fit to be great in a movie that doesn’t require him to fill out a franchise.",2019-04-25,75,christian science monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Movies/2019/0425/Avengers-take-a-bow-in-sentimental-Endgame
33,James Berardinelli,"Avengers: Endgame isn’t as brash, surprising, or relentless as its predecessor but it’s a worthy conclusion to the Infinity War duology and provides a satisfying end to the First Avengers Era.",2019-04-24,75,reelviews,http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/avengers-endgame
34,Mark Feeney,"The movie is ludicrously long, clocking in at three hours and one minute, but surprisingly satisfying.",2019-04-24,75,boston globe,https://www2.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2019/04/24/the-gang-all-here-strong-avengers-endgame/v4SLuBol3fx5WdXMnCb5hJ/story.html
35,Brian Tallerico,"It’s really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration.",2019-04-24,75,rogerebertcom,https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/avengers-endgame-2019
36,Mick LaSalle,"If you partake of the Marvel universe, this movie is for you no matter what. And if you don’t, seeing it would be like going to church if you’re an atheist — an experience of spectacle unmoored from any purpose or definition. In the case of “Endgame,” we’re talking fine spectacle, to be sure, the best that money can buy.But all the same, this one is strictly for the faithful.",2019-04-23,75,san francisco chronicle,https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/review-avengers-endgame-is-spectacular-but-thats-not-the-point-of-this-movie
37,Jake Coyle,"Generous in humor, spirit and sentimentality, Anthony and Joe Russo's Endgame is a surprisingly full feast of blockbuster-making that, through some time-traveling magic, looks back nostalgically at Marvel's decade of world domination. This is the Marvel machine working at high gear, in full control of its myth-making powers and uncovering more emotion in its fictional cosmos than ever before.",2019-04-23,75,the associated press,https://apnews.com/0a72e05fc40e406ca07079abc2249a7c

41,Alonso Duralde,"Avengers: Endgame has almost nothing on its mind but crossing the Ts and dotting the Is of a far-flung superhero saga, but to anyone with even a minor emotional stake in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it has all the fleeting satisfaction of a shot of whipped cream delivered directly from the spray can.",2019-04-23,75,thewrap,https://www.thewrap.com/avengers-endgame-film-review-mcu-robert-downey-jr-chris-evans/

43,David Edelstein,"Even at three-plus hours, the gargantuan Avengers: Endgame is light on its feet and more freely inventive than it needed to be. Given the year-long wait, its audience — Pavlovian dogs, myself (woof!) included — would have salivated over less. It’s better than Avengers: Infinity War, which was better than Avengers: Age of Ultron; and it is, for a change, conclusive.",2019-04-23,70,new york magazine vulture,https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/movie-review-avengers-endgame-2019.html?
44,Tim Grierson,"Not every emotional beat lands, and some action scenes merely repeat past strengths. But between Brolin’s continued excellence as Thanos, a moral monster who believes in the righteousness of his cause, and the filmmakers’ effortless popcorn-movie poetry, Endgame is a muscular send-off to this series of comic-book extravaganzas.",2019-04-23,70,screen daily,https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/avengers-endgame-review/5138686.article
45,Justin Chang,"The inside jokes and fan-service digressions are blatant and relentless, but also pretty effective. The conflicting narrative priorities that often bedevil an epic series finale — how to tell a story that builds with inexorable momentum while also staging the mother of all cast reunions? — are cleverly and resourcefully reconciled.",2019-04-23,70,los angeles times,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-avengers-endgame-review-20190423-story.html

47,Peter Debruge,After nearly two and a half hours of hardcore comicbook entertainment — alternating earnest storytelling with self-deprecating zingers designed to show that Marvel doesn’t take itself too seriously — “Endgame” wraps all that logic-bending nonsense with a series of powerful emotional scenes.,2019-04-23,70,variety,https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/avengers-endgame-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-1203196048/
48,Todd McCarthy,"While constantly eventful and a feast for the eyes, it's also notably more somber than its predecessors.

53,Kerry Lengel,"For fans, counting up how many superheroes can emerge from the clown car of one three-hour movie is half the fun. For casual moviegoers — say, those who might skip minor installments such as “Ant-Man and the Wasp” — it accounts for half the exhaustion, a bit of world-building fatigue to go along with the sensory overload of a fantasy realm that seems stuck in perpetual apocalypse.",2019-04-24,60,arizona republic,https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/04/23/avengers-endgame-movie-review/3543595002/
