0,alva3901,"Infinity War is the pinnacle of what blockbuster films should be. Directed by the Russo brothers, they manage to achieve the almost impossible feat of culminating all the characters and their stories into one epic film. The action, the characters, the story and the overall experience is spectacular to behold. Each characters has their own moment to shine, as we see new fun and somewhat emotional interactions between characters and story arcs that pay off as the film progresses . The result is a film that often feels surprisingly earnest and emotional. It pays off our emotional investment into these great characters over each of the 18 previous films through a great culmination of storytelling. The humor we have come to expect in Marvel films is lively and full of banter, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the quick-fire interplay between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unlike Marvel's cascade of villains who are turned secondary to their superhero counterparts, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is the central character in this epic, with a moral compass that is beyond what many might expect. Whilst he may seem to be the most demonic villain that the Avengers have come across, he is by far and away the most complex of them all, testament to the directing and writing of the film. There's a lot going on in this movie, with many scenes occurring almost simultaneously, leaving the ending on a much vague yet appropriate cliffhanger. Overall, Infinity War epitomizes the perfect blockbuster film that ends in poetic grace and is sure to leave you questioning what will happen next.",2018-04-27,10,56,56,0,English
1,dharma,"Avengers Infinity War is another gamble of sort by Marvel Studios.  It is an astonishing film that assumes that you have seen and is a fan of the 18 MCU films before it. It is not a film that can stood by itself,   It is a culmination of 10 years worth of 'hard work', interconnected story lines, multiple characters that define the MCU.  It is also a film that shows us that Marvel is so way above the curve in comparison to other studios that tries to establish an inter connected universe.  It also ends in a gut wrenching third act that segue in the 4th, yet untitled Avengers film.  Believe me, things will go bad, with many comparing this to the level of Empire Strikes Back.  Acting wise: Josh Brolin is an absolute stand out as Thanos, the main villain. He is the best villain the whole MCU.  The rest of the casts are no slouch either, balancing humor and tragedy in equal measure. The action sequences are also astonishing, with a higher stake: our heroes can and will die in this installment.  An absolute classic that ranks as the best MCU flick by far.",2018-04-27,10,52,52,0,English
2,ViniciusBrito,"The principal reason that this movie worked out so well is because you literally care about every single one of them, you care about them and feel for them. The fact that we already know all the characters very well is just so awesome, like you feel that they are your friends and you are part of them and they a part of you.The story of the movie is very simple, is basically Thanos, the big titan, going after all the 6 infinity stones for him to be able to balance the universe, so our heroes unite to do their best to stop him.For a super-hero to be that good, it is extremely important for the villain to be good, for him no to be generic, and with happiness i say that he is perfect in every aspect. I'm gonna start with the most important, he is not that generic villain that want to destroy the universe just for this very reason, he does have a motivation, a rational reason that does make a lot of sense, you probably don't agree but surely buy the idea, because makes sense and it is in our day to day life. His personality is on point, the character can pass his ideas clearely, he does have charisma and among the villains some unique characteristics, he can express emotions better than a bunch of main characters in other movies. He is scary, you can see how powerful he is and how he is getting stronger during the movie, in some moments that you can just hear his steps, you squirms out of tension, in some moments you can see in his face that he is angry and is so notable how different things get whe he is like that, just at the beginning it does show how mighty he is.They gave him a background, wich helped to make us care about him to.The expressions that Josh Brolin had was so much on point. His Cgi is insanely great, it is so good that doesn't even seem that it is a cgi character, you completely forgets that it is fake. He did had a nice arc.The Black Order characters are all well designed and all had their moments, but only fauce de ebano were well developed, he did had his speech, kid of had a background and all of his moments were dope.The film splits into nuclei, all the heroes start isolated from eachother and posteriorly some end up finding others, and the 2h30min of movie help to it to happen in the most natural way as possible. The presentation of each core is done with mastery, inserting the audience into the language of the original film, whether through colors, as in the case of Asgard, or music, with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Wakanda. The movie does have a nice balance between comedy and drama, even that are some jokes that felt out of place, in the most they did worked and didn't disturb the tone of the movie, it still serious and with consequences. The movie has gigantic scales, it is not like any other movie that you did watched for sure, it is different thant any other, and this is another important factor that makes it so great. One of the best actions that i have ever seen, the movie is so happy in doing the heroes work together and use their powers together, it did make some iconic moments and very memorable scenes. And are moments that are like Lord of the Rings, a giant and stunning war, that i can't talk a lot about it to not spoil.It definely shocked me much more than i expected, there are so many surprises, it is like a napalm, there is so much happening and is so fast and so burner at the same time. Some action scenes just made my hole movie session scream like crazy. The interaction between the characters and the personality shock was done with maestry, they gave time for them to meet up and not feel weird that they are cooperating, all felt organic.If there is some bad things about the movie ? Yes, in some specific moments the cgi doesn't worked and is possibly that it took you off the movie a bit. Some things about the story doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but isn't that crucial and will not ruin the movie to anyone.You do feel the break from one nucleus to the other, i believe that could have had some better transitions, but i get that it is very complicated. There is one specific relationship that i believe that could have been more explored for us to feel kind of how Thanos was feeling in that moment.It did creates nostalgia with interactions of old characters and excitement with the new cross-overs.One thing that this movie can do to us, is let us apprehensives, considering how big of a treat that Thanos is you fear for the life of literally every single one, this kind of thing doesn't happens in almost none super hero movie. It is surely the most shocking Marvel movie.The movie is very creative whe it is about on the using of the power of the stones. It did had moments that happened things that you could never see it coming.Avengers Infinity War, does not have a great story, but is fun and show that not every super hero movie needs to be the same.",2018-04-27,9,52,52,0,English

5,Megajohn85,"Thanos is Right. Best villain ever! The film was a true master class for the genre. An amazing balancing act of tone, emotion, action, suspense and an a 3rd act that will leave you on the edge of your seat with an ending that will make your jaw drop",2018-04-27,10,31,31,0,English

7,familyguy,OMG the most shocking ending ever seen. This is the movie worth watching twice and i did watch it twice. So many action so many character but none of them feel blank . Can't believe they pull of the stunt like that with the ending. Now i hope 2019 come soon,2018-04-27,9,19,19,0,English
8,moviemitch96,"Man oh man! All I can say is this: MIND BLOWN! JAW DROPPED! BRAINS ON THE FLOOR! I'm quite honestly still reeling from what I just witnessed! Well... first thing's first! The pros: Each character had their own cool or unique moments. I was really pleased for the most part with the amount of time each of the characters had in the spotlight! The action in this also rarely let up! Once the movie started, it really got going and didn't slow down a whole lot until the very end!  Furthermore, I felt or went through just about every emotion under the sun while watching this! Joy, excitement, sadness, anger, anxiety, you name it, I felt it! To top that all off, my heart just about wanted to shatter during certain moments! I can't even begin to express how often I found myself yelling at the screen overall! I'll also say that the personal icing on the cake for me was the post-credit scene, as it alluded to an upcoming MCU film that I've been beyond excited for! The cons: Certain character deaths were rushed and unearned in my opinion. And also, some heroes that come to mind that I felt didn't receive quite enough screentime were Hulk, Black Panther, Bucky Barnes, and sadly Steve Rogers too. Other than that, I'd say that most everyone else got their fair share of screentime. And lastly, OF COURSE it had to end on a cliffhanger for Avengers 4 next year, so that was obviously highly frustrating, especially since it left us hanging on a not-so-pretty note, but that's all I'll say! Overall, this was one wild film and quite a lot to take in all at once to be honest! However, I still loved and was actively and emotionally invested in so much of it that I can say with certainty that this was a step above the slightly weaker Age of Ultron, but the lightheartedness and sheer fun of the very first Avengers remains my favorite still, but like I said, you certainly can't go wrong with this one either!",2018-04-27,9,18,18,0,English
9,EpicLadySponge,"What makes Avengers: Infinity War the most epic crossover in cinema history you probably won't forget as soon as you first watch it you may ask? Well I can't say much about the film, but as far as I know, it brings all of its characters from previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films and unite them together to face their biggest threat out of all the villains from the previous films. The way this film is executed from start to end is why I recommend you start watching Avengers: Infinity War in case you haven't yet.",2018-04-27,8,18,18,0,English
10,Moish,"It left me very accomplished even with the fact of enemies not being that much of a challenge to the heroes and the main villan taking its time to win when it could just do it, but ultimately more accomplishing things like tying  loose ends from other movies far back that I didn't think will be talk about at all again giving the audience what already was kind of expecting but not in the way that we did, something that properly motivates and strong ideals for the villan a shaking emotional and full feeling end that leaves you wanting more like this.",2018-04-27,9,17,17,0,English

12,Moche1,"I expected to be disappointed, but this movie delivers on all fronts. Thanos is genuinely a revelation and thankfully not only feels completely real in the CGI sense but also capture every last detail of Brolin's performance. I was completely engrossed for the entire movie. The Russo's wield their own Infinity Gauntlet over the Marvel Universe with absolute control. My only reservation is whether the consequences will stick in the next part; I hope they remain brave and leave some in place. Superb!",2018-04-27,10,192,190,2,English

15,Serraios,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" celebrates the first decade of the Marvel Cinematic Universe while building up to the grand finale of the first era of the franchise and conclusion of its third phase.The Avengers team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Stones and destroying half the universe. That's all that you know before seeing this film, but there is a lot more going on, so make sure you avoid all spoilers.The film offers humorous and fun moments by teaming up several of the cast members together, but it also completely breaks your heart and soul with some truly unexpected, dark and shocking turns. It's also a large scale production, with the Russo brothers offering their best directing yet. As a whole, this manages to top my personal list of MCU films and comic book based films in general, giving the promise of the next chapter to be even greater, if possible.",2018-04-27,10,41,40,1,English
16,Megajohn01,Marvel definitely has now solved their villain problem. I thought I had this film all figured out since usually all MCU films have a rather predictable formula. Nothing wrong with that though. This film throws the formula away and changes things up in many ways. This was a great breathe of fresh air in terms of storytelling. Yes the marvel trademarks are there still but the waybthe film was structured was far different that other MCU films prior and this is why it’s very special. The 3rd act was the epitome of a nail biter and the ending shocked even me a long time Marvel comics fans. I didn’t think they’d a tully do what they did. The entire film was a rollercoaster ride. A must see!!!,2018-04-27,10,80,78,2,English
17,Arean,"This is not a standard superhero movie. Nearly all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies from the past ten years have led up to this one. So you should watch all of those before you start watching Infinity War. Because this movie doesn't give you time to breath and catch up. Loads of characters, settings, items, references of which the movie assumes that you are familiar with them. It's a rollercoaster that doesn't let up.  After preparing for ages, Thanos is making his last moves. He is coming. Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives. Dread. That word actually describes this movie really well. From the very first scene you already know that the stakes are enormous, the threat is immediate and all encompassing, and stopping Thanos truly feels like the greatest challenge in the universe. There are still jokes, heartfelt moments, marvelous special effects and hilarious jokes. Like you would expect from any MCU movie. And amazing special effects, scenery, tech ...There are loads of characters and none of them get a lot of screen time, yet there's still character development (naturally not for all of them, not even for all heroes).This is also a movie about decisions and choices. My only gripe with the movie is that some of those decisions and their consequences break my suspension of disbelief. The fate of the universe is at stake people, come on ... are you really going to do that?! After two days, I'm still processing the movie and may 3 2019 can't be there fast enough to conclude phase three of the MCU.It's a different kind of superhero movie and it's amazing. Go watch it.",2018-04-27,9,38,37,1,English
18,MJAC,Fantastic movie with a very detailed plot. Thanos also makes an amazing villain who believes what he is doing is best for the universe. Although there are so many major Marvel heroes the movie does not feel rushed or bloated,2018-04-27,10,33,32,1,English
19,dangers,"Marvel has managed to surround this movie with secrecy and there are multiple reasons why this was a great idea. This is why you should stay away from all spoilers. One thing that should be said though, is that no one can prepare you for this movie. Celebrating a decade long era, “Infinity War” delivers on all fronts, offering both fan-pleasing material, while also including some shocking and heartbreaking twists and moments.

21,NikoBoss323,This movie has hit all points at the highest level. It was hilarious at some points while still being heartwrenching at others. It portrayed all of the MCU characters very well and gave all of them major rolls in the story while not overpowering any one of them. This movie took major risks and I believe that Marvel executed it to perfection.,2018-04-27,10,31,30,1,English
22,Brock0Tac0,"A compelling storyline, complex villain, and incredible ensemble make for an entertaining and enjoyable ride. This film is packed with jaw-dropping visuals, exciting action, and surprising twists that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. The film masterfully balances its numerous story arcs and characters to create a true spectacle that has never been done before. One of the true character standouts of the film is Thanos, portrayed by Josh Brolin. Brolin gives a compelling and heart wrenching performance as the film explores the trials and sacrifices Thanos must undergo as he travels the galaxy, hunting the six Infinity Stones. Other commendable performances in the film include Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, and Chris Pratt as Star-Lord. Alan Silvestri's incredible score adds a deeper layer to the film's story and is truly one of his best yet. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is filled with heart, humor, and sacrifice that help redefine what a hero should be. The Russo brothers have crafted an epic of galactic proportions that will have fans contemplating long after the credits roll.",2018-04-27,10,30,29,1,English
23,Moviereviewer15,"Here are my spoiler-free thoughts of “Avengers: Infinity War”:10 years of buildup has lead to this. Marvel Studios promised a movie worth 10 years of building a cinematic universe. And, worth it, it sure as hell was. This IS Thanos’s movie. There are surprises no one is expecting. There are character interactions that will make people giddy. But, as much as the humor isn’t lost, even though some will want it to be brought down a bit, lucky for them, darkness isn’t abandoned. Because when Thanos shows up, consequences there are. Trust me when I say no one is prepared for what they see. “Avengers: Infinity War” is indeed worth the hype. One of the best Marvel movies ever. And, Thanos is the best Marvel movie villain ever. Josh Brolin NAILED him. And, that’s why this movie succeeded. Well done, Disney, Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige. You did it.I give “Infinity War” a 5-Star rating.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Also, there is one surprise in this movie the anti-Disney trolls failed to spoil. And, that’s why I say to them when they try to spoil the movie: #NotTodayZurg.",2018-04-27,10,24,23,1,English
24,sgy0003,"Thanos is a very good villain. I expected a one-dimensional madman who talks nothing about destruction, but he actually had believable, understandable reasons on why he wanted to wipe out half of the universe.I also love the fact that everyone gets a screen time. I thought it was going to be one of those ""90 seconds for each character then move on to next"" bullcrap, but it shows everyone's motivation on why they are fighting Thanos.Last but not least, the ending so really shocking it left me saying ""what?"" repeatedly while the guy who was sitting next to be laugh at it.",2018-04-28,10,16,15,1,English

26,The_T-10,"Okay, so in order to meet Thanos' demands, I will not write any spoiler here (At least for now). Truth is, I really feel bad for the quintet of The Russo Bros, the screenwriters (Markus &amp; Mcfeely), and Feige. They literally have the universe on their shoulders. Infinity War is unavoidably overstuffed, but one thing is for sure: Thanos is the main character in here. They didn't mess around with their ""the movie centers on Thanos"" advertising. This is the first MCU movie to have REAL (and I mean, REAL!) stakes, and felt almost real too (Loki's threat in The Avengers obviously had the usual ""aliens come to New York to invade Earth"" feels). The Russos (And the Screenwriters and Kevin Feige) really did the impossible, juggling no less than 30 characters (For comparison, ""CA: Civil War"" had roughly 15-20 characters at max).Final word: Thanos is the OG of the universe!!",2018-04-27,10,16,15,1,English
27,Creeper3455,"Ever since Iron Man made its way into theaters in 2008,that was the beginning of the ambitious Marvel Cinematic Universe,that,from there on out,went on like a New Super Mario Bros game. You complete some levels (the solo movies) all the way up to the final level (the Avengers movie) of each world (Phase).This definitely seems like the last level (almost) of World 3. After 10 Years of waiting we’re finally here,and the hype is so intense that if you say something negative,it almost seems like a crime. That’s why I’ll talk about the negatives first instead of the goods,given that nothing is as perfect as,say,24 Carat Gold. Aside from some unbalanced CG and the score (which needs its own paragraph),I want to take a moment and despise the marketing team. The movie was marketed as ‘’The Biggest Event Of All-Time’’ (a thing most movies are doing nowadays),although the commercials were amping it up to an Interstellar-like seriousness. And while it’s a damn good movie,I wouldn’t say that it’s as good as Interstellar or Once Upon a Time In America,given that selling it like that makes the movie look like a legendary event (which,in part,is supposed to be). Let’s hope the team won’t do the same thing with Avengers 4 and learn from the mistakes.Also,darn it,was the score by Alan Silvestri (Ready Player One and The Avengers) disappointing! Coming out of RPO,I was amping my expectations up for this score,but all I got was another generic Marvel score whose little cues and overall theme will be remembered for sure other than the whole tracklist.Now that the problems are out of the way,there’s a LOT to talk about the positives.I admire what writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (Civil War and The Winter Soldier) did with the story,resulting in a Dunkirk-like structure,where it’s divided in 3 separate stories that,by the end of the movie,get connected together perfectly (like a complicated Puzzle). It DOES feel like if it’s Part 1 of a much-bigger event (the arrival of Avengers 4 in about a year),especially given that we have 79 characters in the ring.Tone shifts every now and then,and it’s a good thing,since each member,with its own screen-time,surprisingly,give you a moment to laugh or cry (Yes,the quips and jokes are there,but none of them detract you from the central story). For example,when we have Iron Man with Banner,Strange and Wong,it gets serious,but when we have the Guardians,it gets funny all-the-way. This is the most ‘Shakespearean’ (I guess) Marvel movie since the first Thor,so be on the look for that. The part I was mostly curious to hear about was how the crowd was going to react to the end,but I won’t say what happened because spoilers.Thanos (played by Deadpool 2 star Josh Brolin) is probably the best written Marvel villain of all-time. I loved his motivation,his charisma,his design,and rife with lines like ‘’I could just snap my fingers and you’d all cease to exist’’ or ‘’Perfectly balanced as all things should be’’,you know right away he’s perfectly written. However,as much as I would go full fanboy for him,I wouldn’t say he is as great of a villain as,say,Killmonger. It’s certainly better than Loki,but where Killmonger came with a more realistic approach,I feel like Thanos didn’t have all the cards on the table to be a great villain,for me only. Everyone will mostly rave about him nonetheless,(even if they should). Oh,and the motion capture is amazing,so…Every actor/actress was amazing all the way,from Downey Jr to Evans to Pratt to Saldana to….Basically everyone.As I said,yeah,some of the effects are unbalanced,but that doesn’t mean the CG is bad. All of the effects are off the chain,especially,as I said,the motion capture on Thanos.Look,if you see Infinity War as a fan,you’ll definitely enjoy it,but as a marketing choice,you’ll probably see it as a disaster on every level. But (there’s always a but) my heart was pounding all the way through the end,I laughed and I didn’t cry for those moments (bit of a serious person),so… I’m surprised to say it,but I’m curious to see what will happen in Avengers 4. Now the annoying part is that I’m going to hear everyone scream in pain for that movie while I get comfy for Incredibles 2. Bring it on,I guess…",2018-04-27,8,16,15,1,English
29,Minh18121999,"Avengers Infinity War is a flawed masterpiece,a tense 149 minutes epic from start to finish.This film,similarly to BR 2049, filled with SO many surprises. IMO Thanos might be on par with Heath Ledger's Joker to become one of the finest villains ever put to the screen.It has at least 15 epic moments.The ENDING was WOW,probably in top 5 Endings in Superhero Films.That being said,it is flawed masterpiece,the pacing of the third act has some problems,and the weight of too many characters in one movie is very noticeable,but these are the type of flaws that are so inconsequential due to this thrilling beast.Still.this film is intense,emotionally resonant,fast paced,visually dazzling and techically a MASTERPIECE",2018-04-27,10,16,15,1,English

32,Raymoiful,"Infinity war is a movie with some good action, but incredibly poorly written and predictable plot. The whole movie feels like a huge shock factor stunt that aims to have emotional impact that weights down on the viewer but ultimately falls flat. The only emotion I felt leaving the cinema was regret for spending my money and anger at the creators of Infinity War, because frankly, there was a time I used to enjoy the MCU and felt like this movie that wanted to represent the climax of all the previous 18 movies ended up being a huge let down.A small advice. Next time when you will again try to create a dark movie with emotional impact, Marvel, try to be a little bit less obvious with your intentions and don't spoil the movie yourself by announcing sequels for all the supposedly killed off heroes before their ""sad deaths"". Be so kind and leave at least a small benefit of the doubt for the viewers. How can we feel sorry for a character's death when we already know said character, no matter how tearful threir dying scene is, will be brought back in the next movie? Do you think so little of your own fanbase? We all know the reason to why only the newer characters (with confirmed sequels) disappeared and the original stayed. We understand all the characters who died after the snap and Gamora who was sacrificed to get the Soul Stone will be coming back. And that it will be by the original Avengers doing in the Avengers 4. We understand it is the original surviving Avengers who are in true danger of dying for real in the MCU in the coming Avengers 4.That makes the characters whose deaths were not inflicted by the Soul Stone or Infinity Gauntlet possibly the only permanent deaths of Infinity War. At least Marvel gave us the benefit of the doubt there. You would think that it's these deaths Marvel takes extra care to make them be felt hard? Well, then you are sadly mistaken. The possible permanent deaths on the list include Heimdall, Loki &amp; Vision (Vision is AI, he can be saved in some way by Tony or Shuri), so characters who were killed off quickly without an afterthought in an opening scene!!! And in this light it brings the IW movie even lower.Always when character gets killed for a shock factor, with the only purpose to show how powerful the newest villain is (I see you Warriors Three), I cringe. As I have already stated, shock factor deaths are just a result of awful screenwriting. Hey Marvel, if you want to create a truly awesome, fear inducing villain, there are better ways to do it. Have you forgot everything about character building? The irony Marvel decided to kill off in this manner its arguably most complex &amp; popular villainous character makes it even worse. Loki was  introduced to us as a powerful magician who could trick even Odin, shapeshifter, user of telepathy, telekinesis, with inborn elementary ice magic, high intellect, manipulative deceiving skills who used to wield not one, but two infinity stones. Loki had Space Stone in his possession, he knew Thanos is coming for years and had time to prepare himself. Yet Loki is not shown fighting or using any of his skills.If someone told me before the IW that Marvel will make Loki go against Thanos with nothing but dagger out of all his skills, I would have laughed. Sorry but to give the very character that once threatened the whole planet of Earth and was the very reason project Avengers was created such a poor last stand was an awfully scripted mistake. Especially when he is the only big character truly dying in IW. The ""no resurrection"" remark as they felt the need to assure viewers that this time the trickster god is really gone was truly pathetic. And there is more than enough eye-roll inducing moments like this in IW movie.Gamora scene. That is HOW to make characters go with honour. Strong scene, with background story and fight. But again, I think she is coming back because her death is connected to the Soul Stone. If not, then this was the highlight of the movie. I sincerely doubt it tho.The only apspect I have praise for in this movie is the amazing acting. Marvel has put together incredibly talented cast and they are doing what they can to make the movie enjoyable. But their efforts are severely limited by the weak and predictable script. This has to be one of the worst movies in MCU.",2018-05-04,3,54,21,33,English

35,43in2014,"The short review: The character and story development are inadequate, many fights scenes felt like nothing new, and the plot felt predictable, but there is enough comedy, anticipation and suspense to make this a good but not great film.Related media: I have seen all the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, so this review is based on knowing what had happened before.What's it like?: Something happened before the film starts that makes Thanos and his henchmen decides it is finally time to take matters into their own hands to assemble the Infinity Stones themselves. So they move from one location to the next, fighting and killing the current holders of the stones. Will he succeed?Post-credit scene: One at the very end but it’s a must-see.Negatives: 1)	A major irritation with this film is the slow pacing, sometimes caused by too much pondering and exposition. Thanos’s destruction of one character/location after another has made the mood gloomy, but when the story transitions to another location, it takes too long for the next thing to happen. 2)	The film suffers from what critics have been warning for a long time – too many major characters in one film. Marvel was able to avoid the failures of DC Comics with Suicide Squad and Justice League, and in fact had major successes with Avengers 1 and 2 and Captain America: Civil War, but I think Marvel has reached a tipping point with this film. With so many characters, they could not spend more time with each character and cover character developments other than moving from one fight to the next. 3)	(Cont’d) An example of this is the fight between Iron Man and a villain. It degenerates into the usual thing of Iron Man shooting lasers and missiles, while being thrown about and smacked with objects. There is nothing new! It becomes another throwaway skirmish, of which there are many in this film.4)	A real problem with any story where the villain is trying to gather a number of powerful objects, which upon completion would render him/her invincible is, where the story goes from there onwards. This problem is made worse here as Thanos becomes more powerful as he acquires each Infinity Stone, rather than needing to collect them all before getting any power from each stone. This principle makes it ever easier for him to acquire each succeeding stone, such that it is guaranteed that he would complete his task. I am really worried as to how the story writers are going to fix this in Avengers 4.5)	There are some opportunities to stop Thanos somewhere in the film but they are wasted because of the stupidity and selfishness of some characters. Some character(s) even surrendered the stones. I think these situations were there just to milk out some drama but they were not well done.6)	The massive attack on Wakanda with Thanos’s army – it’s in the trailer – does not make sense, considering that prior attempts to acquire the stones had only involved a few super-villains but were executed very expertly. It smacks of a cheap attempt to insert a major battle into the film just to satisfy the fans, when it wasn’t necessary at all.7)	The scenes where the heroes who do not know each other meet up for the first time, was not done well. It seemed like the heroes trusted the other side and become friends too easily.8)	Thor and Peter Quill had developed greater powers in recent films, but neither of them used these powers here. Disappointing.9)	Thor remains insecure about not having a hammer and goes to get a new one. The entire sub-plot on this venture felt contrived and felt like an attempt to show a MacGuffin.10)	The strange ending was another gloomy scene. The audiences in the same theatre as me, felt drained, depressed and confused when the lights were turned on. Hang on! This could be just what the directors intended, which would make this a positive!11)	Overall, the story felt predictable and this points to the linear and average story-writing. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 felt the same, but Thor and Civil War were surprising.Positives: 1)	Despite this film being rather gloomy, there were still many funny moments, something that almost all of the DC Comics films never managed. 2)	The film did try to cover the backstory of Thanos, which I wasn’t expecting. Film critics cannot thus argue that this film did not have any character development.3)	The beginning of the film had some of our heroes losing continuously and badly to Thanos and his henchmen. When our heroes won decisively for the first time, it felt really great!How would the different age groups rate it?Children: Excellent;Teens: Excellent;Young adults: Good; Medium age adults: Good; Old adults: Average;  Rating: 4/5 (no half scores).

39,thisistheslam,"I don't know where the critics looked down on this movie. Outside of a so-so start, Infinity War entertains better than perhaps any other Marvel movie has to date. The action was fantastic, there were a few great jokes in there, and for the first time in a very long time I had to fight back tears over something that happens in the movie (seriously glad that moment only lasted for so long because I was ready to unload years of frustration and grief in one moment). It's tough to manage a lot of star power on the screen over 2 1/2 hours but Marvel manages it incredibly well. For the first time in an Avengers movie audiences don't necessarily get what they want and it's both infuriating and amazing. It'll be hard not to dish out spoilers and I won't spill any beans but the table that this movie sets is one of the most intriguing futures I can remember in movies - better than Star Wars (at least post-OG trilogy). Infinity War makes Captain Marvel and whatever the currently unnamed AV4 incredibly important.

If you are a longtime fan of 80’s &amp; 90’s Marvel Comics and Ultimate Marvel, this is the movie of your lifetime. The creators of this film have done what many thought impossible; they have taken a gigantic cast of characters (old and new) and given every one of them purpose, meaning and a soul. Thanos is fully realized and has a purpose and motivation, not just “make the universe evil because I’m evil.” His “Black Order” storm onto the scene and all at once rivalries are created with our heroes. These foes are formidable and full on characters in their own rights. The movie is wall to wall action AND emotion, and it NEVER feels gratuitous. No character is “safe” and the danger is palpable. They make sure the viewer understands that immediately.This story is flat out Marvel Cosmic Universe, no pandering for general audiences.

The humour was on point and timed precisely throughout the film.Thanos motives were great and matches his nickname (The Mad Titan), but still smart in the same way making him a really cool villain. I did not buy that he loves Gamora (-1), that felt so convenient for the script. Another thing is that in 2018 films dont and should not open killing off a black person...white guy gets choked but the black guy gets stabbed in the chest? No way, that's racist (-1).

54,TheJoker168024,"Avengers: Infinity War: 8.8	Everything has been leading up to this. Infinity War’s biggest challenge was somehow juggling dozens of characters coherently without making the entire narrative spread out too far, and it succeeded. Every character gets a respectable amount of screen time that they deserve without any of them feeling like cameos or out of place. From Spider-Man to Black Panther each hero’s intro is just as exciting as the last with each intro bringing the hero’s own flavor into the movie, and this helps the film feel like the absolutely giant event that it is. It has an unbelievable amount of stakes and is probably the most serious of all Marvel movies. There’s harrowing parts to the film that are small and big, but Thanos must’ve had a hand in writing the script because the amount of dramatic and comedic moments is perfectly balanced. The movie is far from short on good laughs. There’s plenty of laugh out loud moments that don’t seep into other parts of movie and ruin some powerful serious moments, which Marvel movies have struggled with in the past. And the powerful moments are POWERFUL. They range from happiness, excitement, sorrow, shock, and sadness. They hit you so hard that after the movie it’s as if you’re suffering from shellshock. Thanos as a villain is phenomenal. Down to his motivations and his CGI he felt like a real person, and not just a one dimensional evil for the sake of evil villain. He’s driven, he’s dangerous, and interesting. This is Thanos’s story, this is his movie. His unique power set given to him by the infinity gauntlet is used as well it can be used. One of the inherent problems with a villain who can basically do anything is that makes you ask “Why doesn’t he do that every time?”. The film deals with that very admirably to the point where that question is actually answered… most of the time. And Thanos’s Black Order are quite dangerous themselves. They feel so lethal that you consider that they can each best multiple Avengers in combat single handedly. Despite the intense saturation of characters and villain who can do anything, the film is actually quite well written in the sense that there is no bad, cringy, or overdone lines. Which is hard to avoid in a big movie that is half the time spent in space. The narrative itself is executed exceptionally. It feels like one continuous story and not a jumbled mess. It almost feels like it’s told in chapters similarly to Pulp Fiction, at least in the first half. Like many of the other characters, the original Avengers Theme(which is a character in itself) also makes an epic return throughout the film. Enhancing the intensity of the story’s biggest moments, while evoking goosebumps, nostalgia, and even tears. When it comes to the films faults they’re little and minor. There’s a few laughs that are indeed funny but are drawn out a little too long, causing the joke to overstay it’s welcome. And during the second act the movie drags a little, but it only might do so because of the great anticipation of how the film will end, and that anticipation may compel you to grow a little impatient. But it’s not fully a fault in the film itself. There’s some actions that the ability of being able to perform those actions are muddled or left unexplained, maybe I might’ve missed the explanations, but it took me out of the movie slightly when it came up. What didn’t take me out of the movie was the CGI. One of the main problems with Black Panther was the overuse of CGI in the film, but T’Challa’s suit is a nice real looking practical suit that looks great. Again Thanos’s visual effects are some of the best ever, and never did the thought of green screen or brief rubbery replacements of characters cross my mind. Overall, the colossal event of Infinity War successfully handles a large plethora of characters while leaving more than enough room for exhilaration, emotion, and consequence that is abundantly present in this film much more than the films that came before it. So I give it an 8.8",2018-04-27,9,11,11,0,English

56,LatinCritic13,"Avengers: Infinity War is one of those tag team superhero movies that will make you laugh, cry, and get all emotional when they are in action. Marvel pulled a big one off their sleeves, and part of that thing that covered on that sleeve is Thanos and they absolutely killed it. Like Killmonger, Thanos may look like a weak villain, but he is not. He is one powerful villain that not any hero including Iron Man, Spiderman, Hulk, and even Dr. Strange will stop by any chances of blowing up the earth, and they are right, he is one bad motherflicker off of this movie that cannot be stopped. This is by far MCU’s underdog villain sitting right next to Killmonger and Loki. And you could easily care about him of what are his motivations when he triggered the infinity war. The action, comedic humor, comic book references, intense emotion, outstanding direction, teriffic stuntwork, and the visual effects is what made Infinity War a powerhouse of MCU movies and it is damn worth seeing it. Without a doubt, Infinity War matches the depths of Logan and Civil War and you would immediately watch it again.

58,ahmedaiman9999,"Hands down Thanos is the best CGI villain ever put to film. He's a compelling character and you can feel he's a real-life human (except he's not). Josh Brolin performance makes Thanos even more realistic and humane. His motion-capture performance adds up to the character of Thanos, and that's really unusual or maybe doesn't happen unless we had Andy Serkis. The CGI in general is very good. Thanos has many great moving moments when he explains his motives, but despite how indirect and classy he illustrates his motivations, I hoped there were more ways to do so rather than using dialogue and nothing more. Also, I think there was no need for more explanations in the third act of the movie. C'mon, there is a final battle happens and Thanos still gives some reasons why he does that!  There's an incredible chemistry between almost all our heroes, and that enhanced the humor in this movie which, by the way, is splendid! Almost every joke hits the mark. The problem that there was a tonal shift between the first act and the second act that made a dramatic scene not as effective as it should have been, but it's really a very minor issue as it just happened one time.The character development features all along the movie itself not just as a complement to the previous movies.There are a lot of shocking moments and unflinching decisions that you have never seen in a Marvel movie.I have never been confused by the story's developments or many events as all of them are represented simply. Actually even simpler than in some other MCU movies.The Russo Brothers showed how much they understand every single character in the universe by changing the tone according to the characters and the place.Avengers: Infinity War is an epic that every MCU fan deserves.

61,Ryugene,"One thing that you need to keep in mind is that this is not a stand alone movie. Some critic reviews say that the only character developed in this movie is Thanos. Well, all other characters have been developed in the past 10 years of MCU. The only exception to this are Thanos' generals, The Black Order, which could have more development. However, it is hard for me to think of what they could take out of the movie to provide time to develop these characters.Another thing to keep in mind is that this is only part 1, so while there is an ending, it may not be a satisfying ending for many. Especially since this movie is not so much about the Avengers as it is about Thanos quest, therefore the movie makes more sensed if watched from his perspective, as if Thanos is the protagonist.At the end of the day, I think the Russo brothers so far did a good job with the difficult task they had in their hands.

Josh Brolin is superb as Thanos, playing the real protagonist of the story as who moves on his insane quest to form the Infinity Gauntlet.  You understand his motivations (though they are based on the long disproven overpopulation myth) and feel when he makes some pretty devastating decisions.  Behind the camera, the Russos manage to a deliver a complete but packed film, mixing up the various MCU heroes in inventive ways (Iron Man &amp; Dr. Strange play off each other brilliantly) while pulling off some brilliant action that sets a new standards in blockbusters.  Granted, if you're not familiar with the the Marvel movies, you will be a bit lost, but then, why would you even be seeing this movie anyway.

72,Jarody,"There is only one thing a person can ask after coming out of this movie, and that question is ""did it live up to the hype?"". The answer, in my opinion, is a yes. The movie isn't perfect, but it had enough interesting surprises and story elements to keep me perfectly engaged. I didn't think one cast member put in a poor performance, they were all at least good. However, Robert Downey Jr. knocks it out the park. This is one of his best performances since the original Iron Man film, 10 years ago. Thanos, as the villian, is perfectly fine. They showed the right amount of human emotion to make him not completely stale, like the majority of marvel villians tend to be. Although, that being said, while he was completely ruthless and evil, elements of the film led me to actually reason with his character, and not completely hate him, which i don't know is a good thing or a bad thing. Now onto the issues. The cast is understandably bloated, so you find yourself having to keep up with all the different storylines happening at once, and it becomes quite difficult to follow everything. It felt like at least two of the main storylines could have been their own movie. There are a couple of plot holes and unexplained events that happen in the film, although it would be difficult to explain them without going into spoilers, so you'll have to take my word for it. The special effects i felt were very inconsistent, at times they blew me away and at other times looked rubbery and formulaic, but luckily the latter part of them were in less noticable shots. Speaking of camera work, the cinematography wasn't anything too special, it wasn't on the level of something like Dunkirk but it had enough interesting shots to keep me entertained. The dissapointing thing about a cast this large is that some characters would be forced to take a backseat, and in this movie some took a significant backseat. So much so, that i forgot some characters were even in the movie. From what i remember one of the most significant avengers had about 4-5 lines in the whole movie. Much like every other marvel movie there were a significant amount of quips and jokes, however i was hoping due to the high stakes and a more serious threat that they might have toned down the jokes but dissapointingly they didn't. That being said, the jokes didn't take away from any of the serious moments. It may seem like i didn't really like the movie, but i have to say, some moments absolutely blew me away, and i believe most came from the screenplay. It's difficult to discuss what i loved without spoilers, so you'll have to take my word that i did enjoy the movie. Not the best ever marvel movie, but nowhere near the worst.",2018-04-28,8,8,8,0,English

75,TenzelJeffery,"Avengers: Infinity Wars, is an epic saga from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as the Avengers rebel against the existential threat that is the overwhelming might of the supreme ThanosThe heroes of the narrative (Downey, Pratt, Johansson and the rest of the gang) are in excellent fighting form (as per usual) and bring undertones of organic humour (particularly Ruffalo and Holland) to balance the impending doom.  Brolin’s, Thanos is an infallible, and unmatched talent among previous Marvel Cinematic Universe villains. The leading antagonist (Brolin) could potentially challenge Heath Ledger’s maniacal depiction of the Joker. This is not because Thanos is a megalomaniac and indomitable being, but his excellency lies rational.  He is deft and absolute in both words and actions. He displays something inexplicably and hauntingly human about him. Thus, making him a fully realized anti-hero.Alan Silvestri’s beautiful layered soundtrack heightens the emotional intensity of the Avengers greatest threat to date. His ability to capture the constantly changing tone and as the inextricably linked narrative jumps from place to place is deserving of praise. The Russo’s Infinity Wars (Part 1) is sure to become a pop culture reference of the future, as they have managed to achieve with the Thanos and the Avengers what Bryan Singer failed to do with Apocalypse (a character of banal platitude) and the X-Men. But we are left with our appetites unsated, and waiting with both repressed clamour and bated breath for the conclusion of the enthralling and dynamic journey in 2019.-RJ",2018-04-28,9,8,8,0,English

That shattered my heart, and Spideys death was a very emotianal part of the movie for me. I cried in the theatre but I will see it a second time. 2 hours and 40 minutes. Most of that is action, action action action. Thats a great move in my book. I thought is was gonna be like your normal Marvel movie. But this movie, it exceeds my hype.

Awesome action, mind-blowing visuals, and some of the best character moments I have ever seen in a superhero movie, both for the heroes and the villain. Thanos is by far the best MCU villain so far, and a villain on a similar level as Darth Vader and Heath Ledger's Joker.In addition, this movie has one of the best cliffhangers in film history. By the time the credits rolled, I was in absolute shock and I was at a loss for words. I couldn't even process what I had seen. Never before have I seen a theater stand up and give a standing ovation for a film.I don't want to spoil anything. Just go see this movie. You will love it.

82,MasterRiley,"Avengers: Infinity War was almost an impossible task, and while not perfect, definitely lives up to the hype. The main issues with the movie just come from the fact that there are so many characters. The pacing is inconsistent at times, not always giving each character enough screen time or enough to do. The tone can shift as well, between dark moments where the audience is meant to feel emotional, to abruptly ending the emotional moment with a gag. But for the most part, all the main characters are given good roles in the movie and characters play nicely off each other. The acting from everyone is top notch and the action scenes are some of the best in the MCU. One of the best things about the movie is Thanos, and the overwhelming danger he puts over our heroes. Villains in the MCU don't always feel like they actually are a threat, but Thanos definitely is. Not only is he a menacing villain, but he is also a well written villain with clear motivations for why he wants the infinity stones. Overall the movie is great, definitely one of the best in the MCU.",2018-05-08,9,7,7,0,English

91,KasaiWolf,"I wasn't sure what to expect going into Infinity War. But I was seriously overwhelmed by what we got. The movie is easily the best of the MCU and defos one of the best movies of all time. The characters were brilliant, the fights were amazing and the story was driven home, especially for the third act. I was afraid all the characters would clash and be all over the place but it worked out amazingly. Characters like Iron Man who was amoung the first to feel the threat Thanos placed, Banner who along with being Thanos' first victim also had trouble with the Hulk that's explored reasonably well in the movie. Even the more smaller characters have time to shine, like Spider-Man who had some good banter with Doctor Strange, Nebula who is given more indepth about her relationship with Thanos and Gamora. Of course the deaths are where the movie truly shines, the first being Heimdall, and then Loki. When your movie has the nerve to kill off one of the most popular characters then you know your villian and the movie mean business. Gamora was another heart jerker as we knew what Thanos was about to do while Gamora herself remains oblivious. Then the big wipe out at the end, heartbreaking especially with Spider-Man and Groot (Dad).

97,The_Man_XX,"Avengers: infinity War has been 10 years in the making from easter eggs,references and hints to this very movie throughout all of the MCU and it was all worth it.The Story was well written and thorough,the cast put on good performances,the action scenes were epic,the tone of the movie was one point and it was just an awesome experience.From the beginning of the it starts of with an intense tone,action packed and yet that contained that Marvel humor and this happens consistently throughtout the film almost near to perfection, thanks to The Russo Brothers directing this continuing their success from Captain America:Winter Soldier and Civil war.The first act was amazing as the movie introduced it's characters swiftly and didn't feel rushed at all with some clever writing and stellar action and gorgeous visual effects.Characters like Ironman.Doctor Strange,Spiderman and Thanos are great from the get go.You really felt there was a genuine danger unlike other Marvel films.The second act continued with this momentum as you are introduced to more characters like the Guardians,Captain America and more and the movie expands on the villain's plan and motivation as Thanos was a great villain,the best marvel villain if not then at least Top 3 although his goal was to destroy half the universe which is generic,but the movie clearly explains why he wants to do so and his clear motivations,as Thanos is also intimidating and also rather emotional helped by Josh Brolin's terrific performance as Thanos so is the rest of the cast who do a good job potraying their characters,the best performances coming from Zoe Saldana,Robert Downey Jr,Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen.However since this was a very long movie the pacing was a bit slow and dragged a bit during the second act,but thankfully not too much and i have to say some of the characters from previous movies didn't get as much screen time as others like Captain America or Black Panther which is kind of disappointing their play a minor role in this big superhero film but but that's understandable as there were so many characters in this movie and The Russo Brothers did a fantastic job of balancing each one right even if it mean't some key characters didn't receive a lot of screen time.Also i have to say some minor thing bugged me a little without spoiling to much this arc involving the Hulk and Doctor Strange which doesn't get full explanations only because it's convenient to the plot and some of the humor from the Guardians of the Galaxy characters was a bit much because of James Gunn not being majorly involved with the movie but again this doesn't ruin the movie,just some minor issues,.Now to my favorite part of the film,the last act which was completely bonkers,the actions scenes were wonderful and looked like they came out straight from a comic book,the visuals were dazzling and story accumulated satisfyingly and there was a sense of unpredictability from the movie as the movie was dark,intense yet fun at the same time and the story was left completely wide open for Avengers 4 as it ended with a twist.In the end i think that this is indeed one of the best comic book movies ever made for sure,the best movie of 2018 so far.It had nearly everything heartbreak,a compelling story,some unpredictability,incredible action,fun humor and more and all i have to say if the wait for this movie was totally worth it.",2018-05-08,9,6,6,0,English
98,Dubeau,"Infinity War is a frantic action movie. This movie is more about Thanos, his motivation, his goals, his vision. For once, we have a real villain in a hero movie, not a doppelganger or a copycat. And the heroes...they just struggle against him, against themselves. The story is a tour de force. To reunite all these characters in a movie and still makes a semi coherent story is not a small feat. The FX are very good but the fighting scenes are sometimes a blur of too many objects and fast pace. Some critics didn't like the ending part...I though it was the best part.  It's not your everybody is fine ending. And you get at least two big clues for a part 2. The music was something that I didn't like that much. I guess it was a very difficult movie to score anyway.

SERIOUSLY?! you mean to tell me the character peter quill is so infinitely dumb that he cant see that thanos is seconds away from losing what is the ultimate power in the universe? and in his uncontrollable rage *sarcasm* cant help himself but to shoot at thanos? this is such a horrible horrible writing flaw that is so easily remedied. if someone is truly so angry with somebody else would there first move in their anger be to help that persons immediate problem? no. a believable response wouldve been to help remove the gauntlet so that they could fight and defeat him, or literally ANYTHING else. it was also a missed opportunity to add to thanos as a villian. he couldve broken free from their hold and beaten the heroes despite them giving absolutely all that they had, making the task of stopping him seem even more hopeless. mantis even tells the others to hurry because she couldnt hold thanos for long because he is so powerful. but no, they decided to crap on what was previously one of the best characters in marvel. its such a dumb moment and its really hard for me to look past which is a shame because the movie had many great scenes.",2018-04-28,7,6,6,0,English

Seeing the Guardians of the Galaxy crew meet up with Thor or Iron Man and Doctor Strange fighting side by side is a dream for fans of the comics, or even just those that enjoyed these movies over the past decade. Thanos himself, a focus of a large part of this movie, is equally excellent and right from the outset comes across as a real threat to the heroes.As with all these Marvel movies I'm sure plot holes could be found if you care to look but all in all Infinity War is an entertaining, and often very funny, movie with a real gut punch of an ending (which will admittedly in all likelihood be largely undone) and its going to be a long wait to see part 2!",2018-05-10,8,5,5,0,English

I, myself, thought it was a mess of tangled characters and half-a$$ed jokes, I mean, I just saw Deadpool 2 and there's a commitment to humor and pop-culture refs! I love how Thanos came across as a sympathetic figure. Finally, a superhero movie where the ""good guys"", even when all gang up on one figure, don't prevail. That's a bit of realism that's refreshing. I could nit pick here and there but overall I'm impressed with and have great respect for a production of this scale. Has there ever been a film with so many A-listers all vying for screen time?! And to add first-rate CGI also? The entire production staff - over 15000 according to end credits - really worked for their money on this one. BTW, the obtuse ending wasn't appreciated, why would they do that?

But my predominant thought leaving the theater was wondering who the hell could possibly follow the film's dizzying two-and-a-half hour story arc ... much less all the individual Marvel story arcs that preceded it, considering 'Infinity War' is the culmination of 18 different superhero movies. I recognized most of the actors (and most of their characters).  But when you have three or four (?) different groups of heroes fighting three or four (?) different groups of baddies on three or four (?) different planets the film quickly turns into an all-you-can-eat buffet of action that, while still very appetizing, is quite a different experience than that of a neatly composed--and somewhat moderately portioned--meal.",2018-05-11,8,5,5,0,English

Granted, there are some scenes that remind you that this is a ""blockbuster movie"", however it's not mindless action like any Transformers, neither is it structurally and visibly absurd like Justice League. Unlike The Last Jedi, it keeps true to all the characters while also giving them the humanity they needed to connect to the audience (Thor). It also excels at subverting expectation (vs.The Last Jedi) mainly due to the fact that you feel the script isn't going out if it's way to ""Trash the Past"" to prop up the newer characters.

118,GBG_Jason,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe recently hit the ten year milestone and for those that have not followed the popular franchise, Avengers: Infinity War marks the first time that a number of the popular characters have appeared on screen together to battle the lingering threat of Thanos. This alone makes the film worth seeing, as almost every single major character makes an appearance.The story loosely follows the Infinity War comic series, tailoring the story to fit the MCU (as well as creatively replacing characters that Disney did not have the film rights too) and focuses on Thanos’ obsession with the Infinity Stones. The mad titan has Hitler-ish aspirations to “save” the galaxy, which involves wiping out half of it to save the remainder and is currently in possession of two of the six stones, with the remainder spread among the various realms of the MCU. While this may sound familiar if you’ve seen any of the other films in the series, what really makes this story special is the teaming up of various characters that have not appeared in the same movie previously which really adds a fun dynamic to the film. This is a bit of a double edged sword, as it makes the film a bit hard to follow at times with so much going on.With such a huge cast, it is to be expected that some characters have more screen time than others, but I was pleasantly surprised to see some of the newer or less popular characters (Dr. Strange, Bruce Banner, Mantis, and Drax) receive more screen time. While series mainstays Captain American, Black Widow, and Falcon appear multiple times throughout, they are sidelined for much of the film, with only a few lines each. I can honestly say that Captain America’s awkward introduction with Groot is one of the funniest lines in the film. The weak link throughout is Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord, who makes a number of questionable, selfish decisions that arguably go against his scoundrel with a heart of gold character the previous films built upon.Up until this point, I hated Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Hated isn’t even a strong enough word to describe my feelings towards him, as I was a huge fan of Andrew Garfield’s portrayal of the character and felt a bit betrayed as a fan when Sony cut his trilogy short in favor of rebooting the franchise with the new actor. On this outing, Spider-Man really steals the show, with his Iron Spider suit that was only teased at the end of Spider-Man: Homecoming joining the mix. Holland’s third time as the wall crawler marks him finally hitting his stride, adding some much needed comedic relief to this film, which was needed to even out the darker tone.While the acting is simply stunning on all fronts, the writing is a bit lackluster at times. Some of the more recent Marvel films have seemed to shoehorn comedic tones into the films when not really needed, which I believe was partially due to the success of The Guardians of the Galaxy. This has been hit or miss; this go around, the writing lets the smartass quips flow naturally from the characters known for them and rarely feels forced. Dave Bautista’s Drax, no doubt a fan favorite in the vein of Groot after this appearance, is simply hilarious anytime he’s on screen.The laughs come often, but by the end of the film most fans will be stoic, if not crying due to the overly bleak ending. The body count is staggering to say the least, with many major characters being removed from the equation. Sure, this is a comic book movie where they could and probably will bring most if not all of the characters back, but I have not been this torn on an ending since The Walking Dead introduced Negan.If you are hyped about the film, you’ve likely seen most (if not all) of the MCU’s other ventures. While many of the past films are enjoyable as standalone experiences, Infinity War requires you to see most of the previous movies to fully understand the narrative and all of its moving pieces. Because of this it might lose some of the younger viewers, as my five year old struggled throughout the film despite it being rather action packed and quick to the point. The fight scenes are all well done and the sheer size of the climax rivals the enormous battles from The Lord of the Rings films. I found the various forms of the Iron Man suits to be a bit overused, as there are a whopping four versions counting War Machine, Iron Man (with his new nano-somethingorother suit that looks more like Venom-like symbiote than Venom does in the new movie trailer), Spider-Man, and a fourth surprise character (you can probably figure this out by the trailer alone, but I won’t spoil it).If you’ve been following the MCU, this is what ten years of work has lead up to and absolutely worth the wait and countless hours invested in the franchise, for both those involved in the film making process and viewers alike. I am just saddened that it’ll be another year before we can see what the next Avenger’s tale has in store for us.",2018-05-07,9,5,5,0,English

133,Loveland,"I will preface this by stating that I am normally not a fan of Marvel movies. They often contain nonchalant humor at inappropriate times along with redundant plots that have no imagination behind them. That being said, I really enjoyed Infinity War. I wasn't ever a reader of comic books, so I won't judge this movie for its portrayal of the comic stories. As a movie it had an interesting plot that separated itself from other Marvel movies. The fact that the infinity stones are the central focus of the movie create the Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter effect where its not simply a battle between good and evil, but rather a race to obtain or prevent consolidated power. While it seems nearly every Marvel movie revolves around saving the universe from a dire threat, the feeling is real in infinity war, as you are given an idea of the power of the stones early on. Throughout the film there were good twists, emotional moments, and some actually well timed humor that all cumulated in an epic ending that set up a sequel film perfectly. Josh Brolin as Thanos made the movie. He is easily the best Marvel villain in any of the movies. Not only was Josh Brolin's acting outstanding, but the writers made him a complex character. Rather than portraying him as a holistically evil being set out to kill everyone, they explained the reasoning behind his beliefs and even made him an emotionally conscious character. As far as the other actors, Tom Holland is outstanding as Spider-Man, and the rest of the Avengers are essentially the usual performances.My problems with the movie mainly focus around my usual complaints with Marvel movies, although to a lesser degree in this one. While not riddled with out-of-place, nonchalant humor, there was some that made my eyes roll during the middle of intense action scenes. The beginning, while action-packed, was a little sloppy in terms of getting all of the characters involved (obviously this is a huge crossover movie though, so I wasn't that surprised). My biggest problem with this movie was the fact that there were some scenes that seemed unnecessary (an obvious example is within Thor's story arc), and either dragged the film out longer than needed, or stole screen time from other scenes that could've been more improving.Overall, it was very well done and very enjoyable, and I would highly recommend this movie to everyone!",2018-05-05,7,5,5,0,English

135,fonki,"This movie is very good. To some extent it's even brave, for the choice of a rather gloomy development, seeding very interesting elements for the next episodes.Cons: - It's a Marvel crossover. whoever reads the comics knows already pros and cons of this. Like the random unnecessary reintroduction of well forgotten characters. And the chaos. And the fact that no one dies in the Marvel Universe.- Good story but slow pace (similarly to Avengers 2).- Some minor story choices. Especially the Thor subplot: quite long and ultimately unecessary; every cool element introduced in Ragnarok is actually ignored here.- the mind stone: i mean what is it? it's the only infinity stone not seen in action.Pros: - Thanos. This movie is about him. I loved it. Even stretching his motives - quite different from the comic - he remains both mad and rational. very well developed.- Gamora. Finally some development of her character, after the disappointment of Guardian of the Galaxy 2.- Badass fightings: especially everything involving Spiderman and Doctor Strange, and Thor.- The time stone: doctor Strange has concocted something!- The soul stone: maybe the best part of the plot.",2018-05-07,8,5,5,0,English

A) Read a **** comic book. B) I don't think they need help generating new movies. Expecting a happy ending in this movie would be like expecting Jesus to sprout Bat-skates at the end of The Passion and mule kick himself off the cross. All I look for anymore in MCU movies is watchable characters, escalating epicness,  just a touch of thoughtful plotting, and in general a superhero story that doesn't end up strangling itself to death before my very eyes. *cough* DC. This movie does just fine on all fronts. I clearly still had my socks on when this one was over, but it all played excellently. I must say I'm growing more and more impressed with Marvel's ability to stuff some humor into every orifice of a script without it feeling excessive or off-key. Best MCU movie, though? Eh. The first Avengers is still the gold standard for plot, but Thanos certainly does set a new standard of his own for his many memorable villainousnesseses.I have to hand it to Marvel; they didn't peter out on The Snap (hidden pun!)

145,MattBrady99,"""Dread It. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.""10 years of Marvel everyone. No words can describe this, like wow. Thinking back to the first Iron Man and now where things have escalated into, it’s insane. While I can be a bit iffy with superheroes movies, but now I realize how this type of genre played a bigger part in my life than before. But now Infinity War, the film those 10 years have hyped and prepared us for has finally arrived, and...holy sh*t.The Russo Brothers did the impossible by making every aspect that many people, including myself thought could down vote the movie for the worse, but manage surpass my worries and made a grand spectacle of excitement and sadness. Making sure every hero has they moment to shine and not be pushed to the background. I mean, these characters are so different from each other, especially the movies they originally came from, but not once felt out of place when sharing screen time. However, you can’t watch this has a single film, because you will have no idea what’s going on or who’s who. Please make sure to watch the other movies before this, as there is so many story lines going on in this movie it’s absurd, but at the same time amazes me how well handled it was. This may not be an easy thing to pull off - The Russo Brother did it without a sweat.The action sequences is wild and beyond epic. The Wakanda battle scene is more crazy than the plot itself. The superhero team ups were all enjoyable, but Thor, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon are the main highlights. Some of the best one liners and dynamic character interactions came from those three. Strangely enough (no pun intended) Doctor Strange was more entertaining and cool in this than his own movie. The back and forward between him and Tony are pure gold. People have pointed out how similar they are, in terms of characterization, in reality are completely different from each other.Now let's talk about the big guy who’s been hyped up since the first Avengers film - The Mad Titan Thanos. I ain't gonna beat around the bush when I say this - he is one of the best villains in the MCU. You see, Thanos wants to save the universe from extinction by killing half of it, this bringing it into balance. Utterly insane but makes sense. Just how he enters a scene with his eyes scanning the area like predator looking for its prey, stopping in his tracks and a devilish grin suddenly appear on his face, which says a lot without words. The visual effects on Thanos is the most realistic CGI renderization ever. To the point of forgetting you’re watching a CGI character. It's scary good. Also he throws a planet. A PLANET. While his presence is menacing and poetic by the way he speaks, but also the most emotional villain yet, with perfect development and depth. Like when was the last time you saw a villain in these type of movies literally start to cry, and I cried with him. He is given a lot of screen time which helps to flesh out the character. Josh Brolin delivers an excellent performance and brought so much to the table in terms of emotional range.Marvel track record with previous villains has been pretty bad, but phrase three have shown a lot of improvements. Not just the villains, but the beautiful shots and having this colorful energy finally gives it more style. The film’s runtime is two and a half hours, and not once do you feel it. The pace is always moving and there’s no time to breathe. The stakes are higher and there’s real consequences. You fear for the heroes for once as your not sure how things are gonna turn out.Of course you should be expecting a lot of deaths, not just supporting characters, main characters. Don’t worry I won’t spoil anything, you’re safe with me. Just be prepared for the emotional punches - however I wasn't expecting how well balanced it was alongside the humor. There’s a lot of humor and don’t let that put you off from thinking it doesn't have it’s dark elements, because it does, just being miserable throughout can sometimes be an empty experience.My only issues were some effects looked a bit unfinished and some of the humor dragged the pacing down a bit. At times losing focus. Peter Dinklage is a great actor, but he isn't great in this and I have no idea what accent he’s putting on. It’s also weird seeing a dwarfish actor playing a giant, just funny to me.Other than those issues, this is a real game changer for Marvel and I can’t wait to see what happens next. At the moment, it's my 4th favorite Marvel film. It's exciting and shocking, yet never hopeless.Overall Rating: That ending...",2018-05-05,7,4,4,0,English

147,PipeC,"Avengers forever!There is plenty to celebrate. Today, releasing its nineteenth movie, the multibillion-dollar American film production company Marvel Studios not only celebrates a decade of glories since the unsuspected inauguration of cinematic universes with ""Iron Man"" by Jon Favreau, time in which, of course, it reaps trillions of dollars for The Walt Disney Company; but also celebrates that its heroes, idealizations of human beings, have become effigies for thousands of kids and grown-ups; celebrates film and comic with passion thanks to remarkable artists who have materialized fictions in the eyes of a humankind in the depths of despair; celebrates life through real feelings packed in gorgeous bags; celebrates it's got an imperishable place in the Popular Culture of the 21st century; celebrates emotional beauty and the complexity of emotions in a shattered viewer who watches; celebrates the endless praises and universal acclaim has obtained with each entry, with every mistake, with every success; celebrates the establishment of a brand that seemed dead in the history of modern cinema— yes, the post-credits scene; —celebrates, at the expense of its interconnected stories, another important establishment in mainstream movies: too many easter-eggs; celebrates the influence that its heroes have caused in the minds of many people; celebrates the start of a grand finale, one more phase, which actually means three phases of triumphs and falls; celebrates that they have built the unimaginable: reaping the fruits of an idea that at first all dismissed — especially production studios, — the fruits that, while represent in monetary gain, also represent a deep-rooted pride of reviving the golden age of comic-film adaptations, building multiverses with more pros than cons where fearless charisma, white humor, feelings, passion, PG-13 ratings and audiovisual high-quality were capital rules in the conception and subsequent production of live-action stories printed in paper; but above all, it celebrates something that is honestly unusual currently: to make cinema, good cinema, human, ambitious, inspiring, diverse cinema with disproportionate amounts as a budget, brilliant. Today, we must wear our most elegant clothes because a long way is coming to an end, a painful, exciting and hopeful end; it won't go away for keeps— never mind — but what we know as Marvel is fading away: marvelous talents, marvelous characters, marvelous messages, marvelous enlightened dreams, marvelous cinema.   ""Avengers: Infinity War"" by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo won't be an expressly idyllic experience for many viewers, what is more, it seems that the mega-event set up by the spoiled brothers of Marvel has switched the game and instead of filling it with nondescript pyrotechnics and visual gags, they morph the accustomed action superhero film into a drama of unthinkable reaches, standing out by the seriousness, coherence, and severity of a script that knows how to use their strengths through characters brimming with soul, personality, and powerful messages. The film veers when it pleases, and although doesn't do it precisely in the best way sometimes, it hits the spot in almost every aspect, causing a really disarming effect, when the credits rolling down, you're still in your seat, speechless, depressed, shocked; no doubt, no superhero film had achieved it to date. Disney's subsidiary company is not jealous of the dark and pessimistic tone of DC, as it has created its own tone with much more deadly consequences than the Warner Bros company's flicks. The first shared universe in cinema history has been manufactured by artists who after long working hours have relegated time with their families to bring happiness to others through adaptations which are etching in our memories. How many kids scamper with Captain America shields in their heads or Iron Man scarlet armors? Ten years of stories as proof of a work full of sacrifices, ups, and downs, But today, after such a long time, the time has come to say thank you, thank you for having transformed present-day cinema, for better or worse. Just like J.J. Abrams'  2015 space opera ""The Force Awakens,"" a new movie-event takes place this year, ""Infinity War,"" the first part of a grim farewell, shakes our senses, its heartbreaking movements deliver a matchless adventure and its strong impact will affect the spectators for much longer, a must-watch. Watching the final scenes is hard task because your eyes are full of tears, that's a faithful sign of what kind of film it is; A motion picture as entertaining as melancholic that shows Marvel's love for his creations and that serves as a very complex turning point leading up to what will mean the closure of a golden superhero century.",2018-05-19,8,4,4,0,English
148,CineAutoctono,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" was an incredible movie, all the superheroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gathered to finish off Thanos, the one who will destroy half the universe when he gets his infinite gems. The development of the villain Thanos is certainly spectacular, its origins and its search for gems is intriguing. The fragments and teams of superheroes trained in Infinity War were very good, photography and special effects as well. The jokes although it takes away the tension in the film, it distracts you a bit so you are not so stressed by what is going to happen and that is a good thing, although some scenes are as out of place, I did not stop enjoying this movie loaded with emotion, tension and action, the end is certainly very devastating, I thought I was not going to cry, but I managed to cry. It was the darkest transition I saw in my life, because I knew the way of being, and Thanos' intentions, he was a perfect and damn superhero terrorist, but a breath of hope will prepare us for an exciting end. Definitely a great movie that Marvel fans, and superheroes needed.",2018-05-15,8,4,4,0,English
149,Rebecca31,"Ten years and eighteen movies have led up to this moment and we're finally here. So feel free to completely lose it because Avengers: Infinity War deserves all of your praise. From the very first teaser trailer the hype and expectations were high but it certainly did deliver. Avengers set the bar quite high and honestly some of their movies since haven't reached the standard (looking at you Age of Ultron and Civil War) and although I was apprehensive about Infinity War part one I couldn't help get caught up in the hype. Everything from the story, visual effects and more importantly the sheer number of characters will drive your inner fanboy crazy. Seeing them all interact with each other is worth losing it over.Thanos (Josh Brolin) has finally made a real appearance, sporting a shiny gauntlet all ready to gather up the infinity stones. The Avengers and their allies must now risk everything to protect the world from Thanos. The tone is much darker than the usual Marvel formula yet impressively it still managed to keep the comedy. It's highly emotional, more than any other Marvel movie, the stakes are higher, there are real consequences and no character is safe. The endless stream of superhero movies we get year in year out don't have much of an impact anymore, they're predictable and safe to the point of boredom. Infinity War has brought everything to a new level. Everyone gets their moment, it doesn't suffer from the characters fighting for screen time and it doesn't suffer from a boring and predictable plot. The back story and character development on Thanos was unexpected and added extra depth to the story. The Avengers movies have always gotten the villains right but Thanos is exceptional. I've always preferred the solo superhero movies but as far as group movies go this is without a doubt one of the best. The superhero genre has finally gotten tiresome but Marvel has given us another terrific superhero movie. Sure it's got some issues, mainly the running time, 2hours and 30minutes for part one seems excessive yet in saying that I've seen shorter movies that felt a lot longer so I can't complain too much. It's entertaining, emotional and fun, the best Avengers movie since Avengers one. There's no real need for a recommendation, all you die-hard Marvel fans have probably already seen Infinity War. For everyone else, if you're in any way into superhero films then yes Infinity War is highly recommended.",2018-04-29,7,4,4,0,English
150,DavidWasHere,"What a movie!It's hard to critique this film in a traditional way in terms of narrative structure, knowing that all of these characters are developed beforehand in the previous MCU films, and because this movie is split in two parts. It is it's own beast! Which is either admirable or infuriating, depending on what I'm feeling on that day.Thanos is great in this movie. Looking past the stupid design of him, the motion capture performance is great (although when he is holding a regular scaled human in his hands it looks weird at times), Josh Brolin did a great job in his role, and he is one of the best well rounded villains the MCU ever had. Sure his plan is admittingly dumb, but in terms of his conviction and even the layers of emotion, he is far more fascinating than the lesser MCU baddies (FWI, there are only five good villains in the MCU, including Thanos). The visuals are a treat to watch. It's eye candy seeing just how much is crammed in there and how much it works. From the impressive backgrounds to the scale of the action as millions of stuff flying in your face. It's almost like a Dragonball action scene done right! Of course, like the other MCU films, there are times where it looks off at times, particularly when Peter is in the Iron Spider suit and Bruce Banner in the giant Iron Hulk suit. The actions scenes, while at first hard to follow, is great thanks to the Ruso Brothers proving once again that they can do the quick cut action scenes. The acting is pretty good overall. I won't go into too much detail because that's what we've come to expect watching their own films from the individual characters. But I will say is that Zoe Saldana does not get enough credit in this and the last Guardians of the Galaxy film as Gamora.If I were to complain, or find something at fault, is that there isn't really a strong anchor in the story. And I'm not talking about character development because well watch the other MCU films to get that, but I mean that in terms of the emotional core, it's downplayed and often rather shallow. There are reasons for what the characters are doing, but in terms of a core story-line there isn't really one, so a lot of the more important characters, like Thanos and Thor, are downplayed to the point where it's basically a movie filled with subplots. If there was a central character or even a central emotional hook, then the movie would have more investment to be a standalone story-line, rather than just scenes happening.But for a ""just scenes happening"" movie, it works very well. It's not perfect, but it is an enjoyable ride if you are invested in the MCU. If you aren't...then why are you here?!",2018-05-08,8,4,4,0,English

Infinity War is not the best film ever and the fanboy hype surrounding it is disproportionate and annoying: the script has some major plot holes, the narrative structure has some issues and some of the humour and sentimentality is forced and/or completely out of place, BUT I honestly can't believe how well the Russo brothers have pulled this movie off. The fact that Infinity War is a coherent film and not a complete clusterf#ck is worth a standing ovation alone, but on top of that the Marvel team managing to create a thoroughly entertaining and genuinely great blockbuster is a goddamn miracle.

Most of them are filler and serve no purpose other than fighting Thanos or his servants. The plot is a little too convoluted and it's hard to follow the story.

157,benskylerhill,"As someone who has serious issues with the first two Avengers films, I hold Avengers: Infinity War to be by far the strongest of the three thus far. It is superior to its predecessors on several fronts, boasting a powerfully developed villain and a plot with genuinely surprising twists and turns. Unfortunately, it still suffers from some fundamental flaws that shall be discussed later on.Infinity War's story is one that serves as a two-edged sword. On one hand, it is bolstered by the fact that--unlike previous Marvel outings--it is entirely unpredictable. It does a tremendous job at changing expectations as the plot progresses. However, there are several times throughout the movie where characters will make completely illogical decisions that completely violate their principles that they have claimed to stand for throughout the story up to that point, and there is no explanation for why this happens. The characters' stupidity thus is the only thing that causes Thanos to succeed at anything he plans to achieve. It's hard to talk about it without spoiling it, but there are so many unforgivably lazy choices made by the writers of Infinity War. The plot's originality is thus bogged down by these logical flaws.Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos is by far the best thing about Infinity War. He brings the character to life and gives us the most excellent, fully developed villain in a superhero film to date. His motives are clear, he's persuasive and decisive, and above all, he's scary. That being said, everyone else delivers performances that are by no means bad, but just do not stand out at all. The fact that so many characters are present really makes everyone involved come across as though they are just phoning it in, offering half-hearted delivery with half-baked emotion. The script is better than the acting, but once again isn't anything out of the ordinary. It's perfectly serviceable for a superhero film.I was more impressed with Infinity War's visuals than I have been with recent Marvel films. The action sequences in this new Avengers installment feel very original for the most part and set a new standard for the franchise.In the end, Avengers: Infinity War is a good start to the long list of summer films ahead. It feels like the fresh blood that Marvel has been needing for the past few years. If you can get past the frustratingly inconsistent and lazily-written plot points and just enjoy Josh Brolin stealing the show as Thanos as well as the pleasantly unconventional ending, this will be a great viewing experience.Story: 5.5Acting: 7.5Script: 6.5Visuals/Sound: 10Entertainment Value: 7OVERALL SCORE: 7.3/10",2018-04-29,7,4,4,0,English

All the story arc's, even though there were so many happening at once, was juggled well and worked out across the entire movie. There was no dedicated character saving the day as per, everyone has their part to play in the story. The character development was superb. The action setpieces just how much money went into the scenes. Character chemistry works superbly throughout using their own personality to work with one another. The villain was amazing, the first time in the entirety of all movies, the villain actually was amazing.

160,DotHackHaseo,"If you fan of the superhero action fantasy movies, you also like this film.Well, I never been comic action hero fan, and also I never been a fan of marvel's film universe. In the past I like some animation DC and Marvel cartoons. Despite this rarely have some comic adaptation, which I love it, like the V, for Vendetta, or Sin City, or Watchman. Marvel's universe really far from this, but honestly marvel's have a certain style, which is enjoyable but in my opinion a little mediocrit. However, Marvel's have some EPIC films, like the best marvel film, the LOGAN, or Winter Soldier and Civil War which is really good.Honestly I want to see this film, I don't know why, maybe the hypetrain hit me a bit of.... but I total disappointing after the film. In point of fact, the film is like many other marvel films, a sci-fi/fantasy with superheroes and funny feeling. And in this film, have a very good antagonist.Bit firsty, technically things total ruined caused by the 30 main charater. The film rushed the scenes, without transitional sceens. Over and above the forced jokes total ruins the drama factor, without the jokes it is maybe works more and more better, I thought. Some main heroes barely can we see, like Steve Rogers, he has 10-15 words in the whole film. But talk about the antagonist, who is the best character of this marvel universe. He has a good motivation, a - little messy, but - good character development, so he is an interesting character. Nevertheless, he has a interesting but total messy plan, and ideology. Clearly THANOS PLAN IS A **** I do not a pacifist, so if he's mayhem works do it, but it isn't.... definitely it is an exact problem, but if anybody have some expertise about History or Geography he knows that this plan isn't works.

161,TeddyRoseReview,"Avengers Infinity War is a massive film, from the cast, the massive villain(literally), down to the massive amount of subplots that glue together to make a very enjoyable film. While it isnt the greatest film in the MCU, it is definitely a must see film. So TLDR: Watch it.POSITIVESLets start with the positives. The characters. The characters in Avengers carry this film. The film makers paired up the characters with the perfect counterparts. This way, we get to see very entertaining character’s charm and charisma bouncing off of each other. I loved seeing the banter between Dr Strange and Tony Stark, or Star Lord and Thor ETC. When the comedy lands in this film, it lands hard. However, when it misses, it can be very cringey.Another positive in this film is how well the Russo Brothers were able to seamlessly shift tones depending on what characters were on screen. Normally, a film that jumps around from light hearted to dark so much can feel like its off balance. But the way that it was handled in Infinity War was nearly perfect. I cant think of a time where I thought to myself that the tone shift felt off putting. So good job to the Russo brothers on that.If you’ve seen any of the trailers, then you know that this film is going to be littered with action. Literally, a very very very large portion of this film is literally action sequences. And it delivers(most of the time). But this can be problem which I will elaborate on later in this review.And lastly, Thanos. Talk about a villain done well. Whatever you think you know about Thanos from the trailers, throw it out of the window. My biggest fear with Thanos is that he was going to be the big generic strong bad guy who is coming to earth to wage war and kill people(the usual). However, this was NOT the case. Thanos is actually a very complex character. As a matter of fact, this film sometimes feels more like a Thanos film than an Avengers film. They put so much time into developing his character and reasoning’s for his actions. And at some points, you can actually get where he is coming from. Such a great surprise from this film. To have such a huge cast and still be able to give this much depth to your villain is amazing and the Russo brothers should be commended for it.NEGATIVESSo you’ve heard me gush over the amazing positives of this film. Now lets get on to the negatives. First and foremost, the comedy. While the comedy is hilarious when the jokes land, its a completely different story when the fall flat. There were many times where I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the jokes ex(Star lords deep voice etc).Another negative is the pacing of the film. Its no secret that this film has a ridiculously large cast. To compensate, the Russo brothers split the characters into groups on specific missions with the end goal being to defeat Thanos. Now this is a very smart way to handle such a massive ensemble cast. However, the way to it is executed makes the film move at a snails pace. Each subplot felt like a different films taking place at the same time. Having to constantly jump away from one plot to another just makes the story as a whole feel so slow. The film was 2 ½ hours yet I felt like I came out of a 3 hour film.Remember how I said that too much action could be a problem. Here’s how. Due to the many subplots going on at once and the film moving slow, the Russo brothers attempted to compensate for this by placing in tons of action sequences between these subplots to distract from the slow pace. While it definitely was a delight to watch, it just made the pacing feel even worse. Because not only do you have to watch the story progress at such a slow rate, you have these drawn out action sequences(that are really good btw) going on that make the story progress even slower. Now this issue will either make or break the film for some people. Some people will be in awe by the action and by too smitten by the amazing charisma of the films stellar cast, while others will be waiting for the story to progress for what feels like an eternity. For me, it just made it less enjoyable.SUMMARYIn summary, Avengers Infinity War is a very ambitious film that has an amazing charismatic cast, a brilliant villain, and amazing action sequences. However, it is not without its short comings with some pacing issues and a little bit of cringe worthy comedy.7/10",2018-04-29,7,4,4,0,English

Before the release, everyone believed one superhero was going to die permanently and eveyone was ready for a whole lot of grief, but killing this much avengers charachters didn't make the viewer sad, but instead it made us believe that they will definitely get resurrected in the sequel.

165,sinbux,"*************** Fair not a MCU fan review without spoilers **************AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR definitely an incomplete movie, it feels like an episode of a serie. Unlike the other Avengers movies which i think they were much more enjoying, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR lack of bond you with a story and instead wants audience focus on CGI effects. Drirector picks a risky way by spliting movie characters to few groups and swaping scene to scene between them. Movie feels like ""trying to tell something but playing it fast forward"".... AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR scene swaps much  more than a usual movie, i know that is a must since lots of characters inside a movie but spliting characters to small teams was a completely ""bad idea"" from the start. Lack of story teling and lots of screen swaps makes movie much like a longer trailer for AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR 2.

167,MorgVader,"The film is not only about heroes, it goes much further, demonstrating how an opposing ideology can gain strength with the right tools. Many viewers did not identify with the film because it did not deliver the standards that the cultural industry forces us to swallow, and on the contrary, it deals with a fantastic issue but closer to reality where being a hero has its price. The plot also unifies all the wonderful 10 years of production of the MCU universe with greatness excellence, creating very well worked arcs and significant for the history. Thanos, the supposed ""villain"" who in my view is not one, has a great presence in the film, which leads the public to not only see him as a devastating being who wants to dominate the world, but rather leads us to know what his purposes and what led him to do such acts. Like all Marvel films, the film has comic reliefs, but they have been properly used since as the plot progresses and as they get closer and closer to the apex of the film the jokes become controlled and ruled. I could talk about many other reasons that make the movie excellent, it breaks standards, has an acting show, impeccable soundtrack, a very elaborate script (talks, ideas, character junction and etc), a CGI so perfect that makes you forget that it is just motion capture, and other other factors that make the film rich and full of small details that provide an experience never seen in this universe. A chilling, frustrating, sad, anguished, and loving experience to see how difficult it is for our heroes to have to face something so powerful and what it can cost them. Congratulations on the film Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and the entire production team for working with excellence.

184,Mackro,"This is a hard review to put into words. As you can see by my score of 9, I loved the movie, but, it's not without it's faults. FYI I won't be spoiling anything.On the one hand, it's a well made film. You can feel the passion that went into this magnificent beast of a film and I do mean beast. This is where we transition to the other hand as this movie is large in every sense of the word. While the length didn't bother me in the slightest (seriously where DID those 2 and a half hours go?) the amount of characters in the movie can be a problem. The problem being that there's very little character development, unsurprisingly as there are something like 24 main characters, and I won't lie, this makes the movie feel ever so slightly hollow. Some characters also end up feeling unimportant and in some cases this feels a little shocking. Even some major players feel like they didn't get their time to shine. Returning to the positive, there is some benefit as well being that these are all fantastic characters so there's never a dull moment.Being a huge fan of the MCU Infinity War was a glorious payoff. Seeing some of my favourite characters of all time interact all together for the first time was incredible. Each faction the characters were broken off into felt well thought out and implemented to great success. For the most part character meetings and back and forth dialogue felt very natural.Infinity War's connections to the rest of the MCU felt sporadic to me. It seemed as though it connected where it wanted to and ignored things it didn't want to deal with. For the parts it didn't connect, I assume they couldn't find an effective way to do so so it was probably for the best that they were not brought up anyway. Still, one event that should have held weight is not referenced even once. The movie seems to deal with characters better than events when it comes to connections.In summary, this is a fun, exciting, well crafted movie that mostly lives up to expectations. Definitely one of my favourites. Now I promised I won't spoil anything, but, whoooo that ending! What a powerful, beautiful, unexpected way to go out! For years since they announced this movie I puzzled about how it could possibly end, but, now that I've seen it, I don't think it could have ended any other way.",2018-05-03,9,3,3,0,English

Which is why I felt the ending was over quicker than I wanted it to. Maybe that's what the directors were aiming for. I wasn't bored for even a second though. The movie keeps you entertained from beginning to end.I left the theater after the end-credits scene and was left with a desire for more.

You will want it to be longer.  Get yourself ready for the culmination of the last ten years of what Disney and Marvel has brought you which is nothing but great marvel movies. There is some comedy in this movie which follows the tone of each of the super hero and their respective movie but its not all flowers and roses.  There are some somber moments as well as some epic moments.  The soundtrack works well with the movie.  This movie juggles the entire cast very well and does so without a hiccup.  Very well directed, written, scripted.  Everything flows.  Cant wait to see part two since this will leave you with a cliffhanger. Marvel/Disney have produced great movies and there are no signs of slowing down. If you are a super hero/comic book fan do yourself a favor and go watch this now.

196,BigDingus,"Infinity War should've been a mess considering all it needed to encompass. However, the Russo brothers, Marvel and Disney somehow pull off a monumental feat in delivering a stellar culmination of the universe they built. It's a movie that manages to be more than just the sum of its parts, and exceeded every expectation I had going into it. Is it perfect? No. But a 10/10 doesn't mean ""perfect,"" or that there are no issues. It simply means that the enjoyment it delivers is a close as one can reasonably hope for, and that the flaws aren't significant enough to detract from all the great aspects and fun it brings.The movie never crumbles under its own weight, and it manages to never lose sight of what it wants to be. The genius behind it is the villain, Thanos, is the main character, and the Avengers (and all other MCU characters) are setup as obstacles he must overcome. This is HIS movie, make no mistake. And Brolin's acting and charisma shine through, despite the CGI nature of the character. Speaking of CGI, it's on another level of impressive, as Thanos not only looks real, but actually as if he's occupying the same space as his counterparts. There is actual weight to him, unlike many floaty, unnatural looking CGI characters in other films (like Black Panther). There's no disconnect from reality when Thanos is present, which if done improperly, could've ruined the movie.And despite some reviews whining about their favorite character not getting enough screen time, I found no issues in that area. The character development is based primarily around Thanos, and his character arc is the focus. There are 18 other MCU movies that focused on developing our protagonists, and Infinity War doesn't hold your hand with contrived, meaningless time-wastes, just there to introduce characters for the first time to those who may not have seen any of the prior films. The movie is already 2 hours &amp; 40 minutes, why dumb down the product when the large majority are familiar enough with the characters to fully grasp what they're viewing? All major players get their time to shine, as do many of the minor and less popular ones do. Anyone who feels there's too much going on, or that there's too much to follow clearly were focused on other things instead of watching the movie. The premise is simple - Thanos is traversing the universe gathering the infinity stones which will give him nearly unlimited power, and the Avengers want to stop him. That's it. Every scene in the movie is based around that premise. Whether we're in New York watching Doctor Strange &amp; Iron Man take on one of his minions, off in space with Thor, Rocket &amp; Groot trying to forge a new weapon to stop Thanos, or in Wakanda trying to make a stand against Thanos's army who are attempting to take the Mind Stone from Vision's forehead, it's all about the heroes planning, defending, and attempting to stop Thanos from achieving his goals.Lastly, it'd be a disservice not to mention the emotions, interactions and gravity Infinity War successfully brings to the table. There are laugh out loud moments, thrilling moments, tense moments, sad moments, and moments where you're left in awe. Yes, there's humor (most of it in the first half of the film), but it's not even close to ""forced,"" as some MCU movies have been guilty of. It's fluid, organic and right in line with the characters delivering the laughs. Spider-Man, Drax, Star Lord, Iron-Man, Rocket...those characters SHOULD inject humor from time to time, as that is their nature in the comics. Gamora, Captain America, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, etc. are the more serious ones who anchor their counterparts to reality. It's as it should be, and it's why ""forced,"" is not an adjective that would apply to this film in any way.The ending does end on a bit of a cliffhanger, but more so in the way that you are left wondering ""what comes next?"" and ""how will this affect our heroes going forward?"" Make no mistake, there are real consequences, and when Avengers 4 comes out next year, it will not simply do a 180 and go back to status quo (like many internet-experts believe). The only real question is how far will they go with the permanence? If you believe the Russo Brothers, quite further than people want to believe. TL;DR - Fantastic movie. The Star Wars saga of the new generation. Kids growing up in the era of the MCU will look back and remember Iron-Man, Thor, the Hulk, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc. like those from the 70's-90's grew up feeling about Luke, Han, Leia &amp; Vader. It's a celebration of all that has come before it, and a success in what they set out to do 10 years ago. Sadly, we have to wait a year for it to reach its conclusion. 10/10",2018-05-04,10,3,3,0,English
197,NolanLundgaard,"Let me get this point across first: Infinity War was amazing! I loved how it “perfectly balanced” humor with serious parts and with action scenes. This film definitely lived up to my expectations and was worth the wait. I only have two gripes against the latest from MARVEL. My first: Throughout the whole film, the Hulk was so annoying (I won’t tell you why because then I’ll have to check the “hide review” box). In addition to this, I felt the Movie could have been over so much faster if the characters had not done what they did at some point in the movie. That being said, Infinity War felt neither too long nor too short and this might be one of my favorites from MARVEL yet (second to Captain America: Civil War).

217,GrantD243,"Avengers: Infinity War is the biggest superhero movie release of the year by far. Everyone, and I mean everyone, either plans on seeing it or already has. I was looking forward to it, but I've started to get a bit of Marvel fatigue, personally, so I wasn't as hyped as I was in 2016 and earlier. The Marvel formula has just started to wear on me a bit. I expected Black Panther to break that mold based on the amazing reviews it got, but ultimately I was given another formulaic, solid Marvel movie. So while I was looking forward to watching Infinity War, I wasn't expecting it to blow my socks off. But it did just that: It blew my socks off. This movie is the culmination of the first 10 years of Marvel movies, which means that damn near every Marvel character we've seen in the movies (apart from Ant-Man and Hawkeye) are in it. And the plot follows the Avengers and various other small groups as they all attempt to stop Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the universe's population. The biggest problem I've had with the Marvel movies as of late is that there is no sense of danger. The villains never pose a real threat. It's always known that the superhero(s) will prevail and win the day. Infinity War...Infinity War is different. Much different. There is a sense of danger. There is even a sense of hopelessness at times. And as a result, there is no doubt in my mind that Thanos is by far the best MCU villain yet. I was also surprised at how well this movie works with so many big name characters. Does your favorite character get as much screen time as you may want? Probably not, but everyone gets fairly even amounts of screen time, all things considered. There are some pacing issues, but I feel like this is about as good of a movie as the Russo brothers could possibly make with all of the characters that are in it. At the end of the day, Infinity War is one of my favorite MCU movies yet (I'm not willing to give it a ranking just yet). It finally broke the mold that was starting to get a bit worn, and it sets the universe up for the next Avengers movie, which I'm fully expecting to be as good, if not better, than Infinity War.

I watched spoiler before the movie, and I know who will die or will not, but I still felt a sense of danger.3. No more chicken fights like the previous two.4.

231,Davrosdaleks1,"So after years of Marvel movies leading up to this event: Thanos and the Infinity Stones in what is a combination of all the films, the question was: Could such an ambitious feat succeed. Answer: Surprisingly yes.There is just so much going on in this: charismatic superheroes interacting with each other again or for the first time, a lot of unexpected developments, and excellent large-scale fight scenes, special effects, and sets. I especially liked the design of Thanos' main space ships. Very unique.This is pretty much Marvel's The Empires Strikes Back, and is by far the darkest and most mature in the franchise. Trust me, this movie will be making you feel things by the end. On the other hand, the humor and characters do balance things nicely. As for Thanos himself, don't worry. All the waiting and teasing isn't for nought. He is, with Loki and Killmonger, one of the franchise's top villains. Josh Brolin does a wonderful job of playing the guy, both twisted and threatening, but in a calm and almost relatable manner.Not to say the film doesn't have its flaws, which is completely understandable considering that it juggled so many characters and places. Think of this as a war film, like Dunkirk, The Longest Day, or a Bridge too Far, that features various people affected by or involved in a battle. Though there are some strong moments, the cast just can't shine as brightly as they do in the solo films. Not all character relationships could have developed as much as they could and some characters you hope will meet won't. The Thor subplot also goes on too long. It could have been shortened to make way for other things.The first quarter of the film suffered from too many close-ups shots and quick cuts, but that does seem to settle down as things goes on. Though the film did an admirable job of keeping the tone of the characters, there were moments with the Guardians of the Galaxy in which they could've cut a few jokes. Having them act moronish during certain moments did cut the tension a bit.Also, not fond that Thanos' three regularly proportioned adopted children  and lieutenants were computer animated instead of makeup like Gamora and Nebula. They just kind of stood out, and it didn't help that they weren't computer animated quite as well as their father. However, I don't agree with the complaints that they weren't well-developed. I mean, yeah they weren't, but they served their purpose as effective and distinctive threats for the heroes to fight. (You can't have all Darth Vaders. You'll always have some Boba Fett's.)Now, I can't recommend this to anyone who's not very familiar for the movie series as it'll probably leave them confused.

Each character's thread is good, but the transitions are often very quick, and not very smooth. It is possible to lose track of exactly where each part of the plot was by the time you get back to it. This could be viewed as a lack of cohesion if you aren't interested in exactly what they are doing right now.Overall it was fun, engaging, and well made.

Stakes are higher, you can FEEL THE DANGER! ​In this movie unites nearly all MCU, many comes to some sort of resolve, but yet opens huge pool of questions.Despite what happens, who dies or who does not die, it seems to me that some of those people will come back for second part regardless, because it is not really clear.

Infinity wars has the most well developed villain they've conceived thus far, and this is what makes the movie so interesting.

249,MrMovieBuff,"Marvel Studios celebrates its 10th anniversary with possibly their biggest and most ambitious film yet, 'Avengers: Infinity War'. A movie jam-packed with more than 60 main characters facing just one (albeit very powerful) villain, Thanos (Josh Brolin). You pretty much know the story, and it's very simple... Thanos is after six infinity stones (some of which we have seen in previous MCU films), and the Avengers, the Guardians, and other heroes do everything they can to stop him and protect those stones. What makes this movie work is that we see different characters meeting those they haven't met before, and the constant personality clashes do make for great comedy (something I've been very critical about in previous MCU films, mostly from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and its sequel). The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat as you feel the tension that is about to rise and the danger feels almost too real for this universe. We also see some characters in their best form, but the most important thing to keep in mind is that this is mostly Thanos' story. The backstory and development we get from this character is so easy to understand and you find yourself - at times - wanting to root for him, yes, I just said that. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who made two fantastic ""Captain America"" sequels - they manage to juggle and balance so many of these characters so well, and a very busy screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely still somehow manage to let the quiet moments sink in, while attempting to throw some of the biggest action set-pieces ever. It might actually be better than 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016). What I loved most about this movie is also the way it is shot. Without going into too much spoiler-filled detail, very early on in the film, a character, inside a building, feels some shaking as if there's an earthquake approaching. He steps outside and sees a crowd of people running towards one direction while he walks down the opposite direction. The camera stays behind him at shoulder-length. Some people trip and fall as they run, and he helps them up and asks them if they're okay and tells them to get to safety, the camera hasn't cut... we are still right behind him. He turns to a corner, and sees a particular device bigger than any landmark or skyscraper which is assumed to contain enough power to wipe out the population. The camera tilts up as he looks up in awe and fear. The reason I praise the camerawork, especially in this scene, is because most action movies (like the previous ""Avengers"" movies), would always cut to a wide shot of a giant device hovering over a city as if we - the audience - are giants looking down on this device. This particular camerawork is better because we get a sense of the scale of the danger, because it makes us feel small and vulnerable. The Russo brothers were wise to use this technique, and it's a technique I don't think gets enough praise. We saw it with 'Jurassic Park' (1993) right to 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015) where the camera remains on ground level, but for some reason, other generic action films feel like they should make us big. All in all, if you're a Marvel fan, of course you're going to see this film. Fandango has already reported that pre-ticket sales suggest this film will crush several box-office records. Thanos is definitely the best part of the film, Marvel has sorted out their villain problem, and what makes Thanos so great is mostly down to Brolin's intimidating, yet, heartfelt performance. This is not a movie a Marvel fan will want to miss.",2018-04-27,9,8,7,1,English

The Russo Brothers do a great job of giving each character their moment (and making each new character interaction memorable), while also giving us the best Marvel villain (and arguably the best comic book movie villain) of all-time. Thanos is both incredibly powerful and is given motivations that makes him unique compared to most other big bads. While the ending does make this feel like a Part 1 out of 2 film, I think the ending is what ultimately makes this film work.

257,Cres26,"Where to begin with this, I suppose starting off with the good first would be a good start. Thanos comes off as a fantastic villain, his motivations for his actions are actually justified and is a problem the real world will eventually face. Unfortunately though if you're a comic book fan this is about all that will come out of this. Not that the movie is bad, but Thanos has a ridiculous amount of plot armor. Doctor Strange had the opportunities to completely avoid any and all of this mess by simply sending Thanos to another dimension for example but Doctor Strange never used his full power on Thanos. Also after meeting the Guardians of the Galaxy and learning that Thanos had Gamora, couldn't Doctor Strange just teleport to her and bring her back thus preventing Thanos from getting the Soul stone? Or Doctor Strange could've brought everyone back to Earth and we could've had Thanos fighting all of the heroes. On the surface this movie will seem good, there are deaths, a justified villain, and some funny moments. But the fact that my girlfriend who's only exposure to the Marvel Universe has been the movies can sit with me and poke holes in the plot proves that the writers didn't know how to handle the more powerful characters in this. Overall if they didn't include the Sorcerer Supreme this movie would've made a lot more sense on why things happen like they do.",2018-04-30,5,16,7,9,English

The heroes that did have the spotlight made stupid/weak decisions and so did I for believing this would be a good film.

259,AndrewBurge,"Fun is over for the Avengers, (or rather what was left of them after the feud between Captain America and Tony Stark). This double-directed entandre by the Russo brothers (Anthony &amp; Joseph Russo), 'Avengers: Infinity War' throws itself at you right from the very first scenes with the same merciless attitude of its antagonist, Thanos (Josh Brolin).Indeed, this film not only that it successfully delivered on its hype, but then some. From start to finish it is filled with decisions containing heavy repercussions, killing off important characters and altering the universe on a scale that ripples through the entire MCU all while looking you straight in the face and saying ""deal with it"".Yet, for all its glorified and profetic killing done by probably one of the most deep villains the Avengers have ever confronted, the film manages to find a soft spot, although barely, creating relationships and then destroying them with the same old ruthless efficiency. Also, few movies manage to get the villain to wreak so much chaos and still make you feel sad for him. Yes, Thanos, is not the cold-hearted villain that you saw in the trailer, rather his motivation for his crimes weigh heavy on him and he suffers for his actions maybe even worse than everyone else. (I would like to include a scene here, but for the sake of keeping this spoiler-free, I will not - Gamora and the Soul Stone).Despite its dedication to its villain, this film's foundation eventually starts to shake a bit under its plethora of characters. But I will not be to harsh on this, as this is a film which attempts to focus on characters which were built throughout a decade of writing strong personalities for each and every one of them. So, for all its slight looseness and occasional episodic and isolated content spread through four to six sub-plots at a time, it holds up pretty good. An example where the film feels as if starts to panic under the number of characters its when it attempts to include some of them through jokes which, for the first time in a Marvel film, do not land perfectly (like Spider-Man's pop culture references and Groot's growing pains).Overall, when it comes to delivering stellar visuals and giving heart-attack inducing orgasms to every single comic book nerd, 'Avengers: Infinity War' delivers, even though, as expected, it lacks a bit in managing its diverse and gigantic universe.",2018-04-28,7,7,3,4,English
260,MichaelA91,"A good looking weak movie. You might enjoy it more if you absolutely love super-hero movies.Do you like movies that are too unfocused and have so many story arcs that go nowhere just so they can promise to tie them together somehow in a sequel so they don't even have to try to resolve the main conflicts they set up through the movie? Then this is the movie for you ! A movie with absolutely no value unless you've watched all the previous movies leading up to it AND are 100% sure you WILL watch the sequel whenever that comes out.That being said, if you liked generic super-hero movies you'll absolutely LOVE this one, it's got more out of context fan-service than anything I've ever seen which, given you love what came before it, will be moments you actually enjoy.The visuals are great, the performances from almost all of the secondary characters is great, the only ones of the big name actors that are phoning it in are Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. (and in his case he's still not that bad compared to the others, but he is worse compared to how he acted in the Iron Man trilogy).The story is incredibly incomplete and can't be judged adequately until it's finished however it does have a lot of moments where you'll be thinking: ""Well why didn't they just do X instead of Y, this is a terrible idea and I'd actually be insulted if it works"" it's not any worse then it's been in the previous Avengers movies but it's not any better either.Every character gets at least 1 chance to show off on the screen and it looks great for all of them even though the way the moments are woven into the story seems contrived and forced.The villain is a boring guy with an absurd evil ideology, he's barely a step up from Red Skull in terms of motivations. It's amusing how bad his plan and motivation are, his plan is something the magnitude of Hitler's Final Solution without actually being ""Final"" in any way, he feels like the most generic comic book villain you can find in every way except his acting which is excellent.It's a CG spectacle with no sense of direction.

262,TrevorsView,"I’ve never been a Marvel Cinematic Universe fan; back in May 2012, the midnight premiere of The Avengers before I became a huge cinema buff, the only addition of the series I saw was Iron Man, which I felt no desire to watch again. I only bought a ticket to The Avengers because some friends invited me. Afterward, virtually the whole world went nuts and called it the greatest motion picture ever, I however just saw horrific, nauseous action void of artistic purpose. While softer attitudes towards Marvel eventually came my way, people praising ridiculous junk food over quality art still sickens me.Even today, Marvel representing the early bane of my taste in movies still affects my outlook upon Avengers: Infinity War. Like Rocket Raccoon’s mockery upon anybody different, Marvel’s corporate heads blare their red logo in its abused emotional manipulation, whilst their followers turn a deep azure hue in moral discouragement.This incorporation of many characters turns toilsome on a full bladder, since long stretches between subplots average between 20-40 minutes until returned to. The editors couldn’t keep them consistently active, but sure, they got enough time for infinite out-of-place jokes! Thor’s first scene with the Guardians alone contains nonstop laughs increasing the total runtime threefold. Gags continue throughout serious beats, particularly one where Drax snacking on chips interrupts a sad romantic exchange.There are plenty… PLENTY of other flaws that ruin other evocative moments; whenever two combatants start punching and kicking, feeble battle choreographed by eye-sore camera movements looks set on anything besides vengeance. Rage seldom reaches full capacity, since no actors stayed on the same page: One aims to be optimistic (Chris Pratt), another aims to be deadpan (Robert Downey Jr.), and another cannot decide (Elizabeth Olsen), all cold in believability. Chadwick Boseman should take most of the blame as he continues his noncombative blank stares, alongside Chris Hemsworth as his obligatory smile disrupts any flow.You’re probably sick of me bashing a property you love, so I’ll give a few praiseful bits.After you acknowledge how Marvel’s surface visuals trick you into thinking it mastered sentiment, its subtext ends up quite effective. Right away in scene one, when Thanos takes down Hulk, he sets off a gradual growth of surprises, a greater threat in the end than at first.  Even more noteworthy, he plays a crucial role to Gamora’s arc, continued well off Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Though during his Infinity Stone hunt, Thanos has three motiveless extra-terrestrial children, who in turn weaken the intentional threat he’s supposed to give.The Russo brothers might potentially become phenomenal artistic directors in the future—they give each superhuman a satisfactory conclusion in the heavy-handed finale. Rocket Raccoon also receives a suitable amount of attention into a complex persona, alongside teenage Groot, who represents a teenager’s wartime psychology, only leaving his gaming device once he finds sudden flashes in deep deliberation. Soon, comicality stops altogether in an approach that overbears the remedy of many heart-shaped herbs.Alright, enough praise. Here’s a clear perspective against the overhype of such a gimmicky unforeseen divergence from Marvel. Last Friday, Avengers: Infinity War skyrocketed up to #10 on IMDb’s Top 250, bumping up to #9 on Sunday (though it’s back at #10 now), surpassing genuinely good films: Saving Private Ryan, the Star Wars original trilogy, The Green Mile, Amadeus, and even Citizen Kane!These classics knew how to present new ideas in clever ways, something the Russo Brothers failed at. Nothing they did here is as clever as you would want to think… the climax alone rips off The Lord of the Rings, an enduring trilogy about healthy retaliation, in its grand epic scale. Now, I understand Marvel does honor Stan Lee’s created universe enough to allow greater depth than previous superhero establishments, except those corporate heads beneath Disney’s control still insult the art of filmmaking by taking advantage of consumers for the sake of bank.Instead of futile cash-bait, imagine if we celebrated genuinely intelligent narrative commentaries on true problems? Or better yet, stopped hating on DC fanboys because of foolish loyalty to nonexistent people with abilities we could never hope to obtain? Then I can guarantee you that the world would become a much kinder place without the need for a dictatorial jerk in a dumb America costume telling us what’s important in life.",2018-05-03,3,20,8,12,English

264,MrGameGuy,"Marvel has been building up to this conclusion for 10 years now, and have made a promise of a great conclusion. I am happy to say that Marvel has definitely delivered on that promise. Infinity war is both surprising and intense, but also has some light jokes and moments, which help stop the film from becoming too dark. The characters are the best part of the film, as throughout the whole 2 and a half hours, I did not see a character that I didn't like. High points for me include Doctor Strange, Star Lord and even Thanos, who unlike most villains, has a deep story and character. The only minor negative I have is there are so many characters, which makes the film seem slightly crammed. The film is also extremely surprising with so many plot twists. I never knew what to expect from the film, as when it seemed the film was on a straight track, it took a turn in a matter of seconds.

275,djdiscotex,"Unlike any other film in history, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (Or Avengers 3 if you exclude the other Marvel films), is unique in that it is not trying to tell us the kind of story we're by nature expected and conditioned for. Over the past hundred decades of film, let alone other dramatic works, American film-goers are used to going into a film and seeing a first, second and third act. We need time to establish characters. Without clear defined characters that the audience will come to care for as the film progesses, the audience loses interest in them no matter how high the ""stakes are raised"". This simple, tried and true film structure is not necessary in 2018 when it comes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In a decade Marvel Studios has managed to build a universe populated with dozens upon dozens of characters, spread across nearly 20 films and know and beloved individually by a seemingly unending growing of fans.Instead we are treated to a film told with a new story structure. Now this alone is nothing new. The French New Wave's lackadaisical, emotional, free-form films to the horror and turn on a dime, maze like structures, have presented us Americans with plenty of wonderful other less conventional approahces as have of course American film-makers (think the Star Wars trilogy applying this structure across 3 films to Harry Potter's 7 film run); this film has no need to establish any of its characters save one: its villain.And what a villain is Thanos? Probably the first to arguably steal the show on the level of Jack Nicholson's Joker (though Marvel's Disney's sheen robs the character and films tone of the darker touches necessary to top Heath Ledger's take, while the damage these two iconic comic villains do is incomparable, Nolan's Batman trilogy is a good reminder of how stakes can be as large or small as one wants, so long as time is spent establishing them. So here we find our films two thru lines. The story of Thanos, the Mad Titan, an unstoppable being seeking the ultimate MacGuffin. One in which he will be given powers over... well, everything. [NOTE]: This is show in terrifying detail and small kiddos should not see this film. If your child is under 10 and sensitive and in love with these characters, make sure they're prepared to handle death. Now before I be charged with spoiling anything, I do not mean to say that anyone dies in this film. However, the threat of death looms over every scene our various heroes are in. Over 40 some characters, all well known to fans who have seen all films; or simply beautiful to behold to new viewers. If you have seen the prior 2 Avengers movies you will be able to follow this film. A follow up will arrive in roughly one year and deal with the aftermath the wrecking ball that is Thanos has left in his wake and whether or not this story is over and our chance to see how Marvel handles stakes going forward.So how does this tale of two stories intertwined hold up on the screen? Quite well. The familiarity with the characters reminded me of my first time watching ""The Two Towers"" and instantly knowing who was who in more complex world than most we're presented with in the traditional 2 hours a film has to tell is story. What is surprising about Avengers: Infinity War is that it could also be called ""Thanos"". The heroes appear around him--they certainly must deal with him--but this character steals the show and I loved every second of this very long film. James Brolin deserves all credit for carrying this film which would otherwise have been nothing but a series of B-plots reducing our heroes tale to mere fan-service scenes (a problem the rushed Avengers 2 suffered from), although the core cast remain tremendous even when they're mostly given little to do but stand in awe, fight and hurt. The introduction of the Guardians of the Galaxy appears out of nowhere--literally--though they prove a welcome (if frustrating) addition. On the one hand their presence is necessary to cross our heroes tale with Thanos in a manner beyond mere CGI armies clashing as they perennially do. Instead, their members give us an emotional component to both our heroes and Thanos in enough of a way to justify their appearance. That said, event movie goers unfamiliar with the Marvel films will struggle most following their thru-lines and relationships.-Disco Tex.",2018-05-06,9,5,2,3,English

279,MegablastX,"Spoilery Review...The NegativesThis movie had a bad idea from the start... Have all the characters at once. It's like they forgot Character Development. The story felt like Sonic Heroes where they were separate stories that collide at certain points. Except Sonic Heroes didn't have Plot Holes. If Thanos had all the power, why not double the resources instead of Half the Population. It has the same affect without half the people dying.Next up, the ""kill list."" Out of all the characters to kill, you chose they exact opposite of what you should've died (disintigrated, the people who die died were fine). You killed Black Panther, Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Winter Soldier, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Star-Lord, Drax, Groot, Mantis, and Nick Fury. You killed off all the new people. Now the original Avengers have to save the day. Next time give the brand new Marvel characters a chance without help. They seem casted out, like they want only the original Avengers to have screen time. Nick Fury is the only one that should have been disintegrated who actually was.The 20 something charactersThere are so many heroes I don't even remember how many there are. There is so little time to add ANY character development.The PositiveThis IS a Disney movie, so when it comes to acting, action and CGI, it does have that level of polish.Take this with a quarter grain of salt, because I love SpiderMan and Black Panther, but I know they'll come back at some point.

280,RealMuthaF,"Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone ""for balance"" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable.

286,avr50,"Infinity War is one of the most unpredictable movies of the marvel cinematic universe (even when it has some predictable things) The movie is entertaining and funny, is an 149 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it. The performances of all the actors is really good, but I had to highlight the performance of Josh Brolin  as the villain, Thanos. The character is terrifying and you can feel that something could go terrible wrong when he´s on screen, he is the character that, to me, is the most interesting in the movie, and thetas really good, because a movie like this without a great villain could not be a good movie, and Brolin brings something additional to the character with his performance, even when the character is made by CGI, the performance is still very powerful, is like Andy Serkis as Caesar in the new Planet of the Apes movies. The visual effects are, of course amazing and makes what the best visual effects do, make you believe that what is on screen is real. Now, I have to speak about the negative points of the movie. First, it is a lot, the story tat they´re telling here could have been not a bit of a mess (like it is the movie) if they were telling it as a 10 episode series or something like that, but a movie can´t do that, so the result that we have on screen is a lot, and sometimes you can forget what some characters were doing at the beginning of the movie because they appear in minute 10 and the appear again on minute 40. Of course, everything that´s going on is important, but that problem makes you feel a little disconnected with some characters. Speaking about the characters, there were some that were really useless in the movie, and they were only there because they were introduced before. Stay for the scene after the credits, it is amazing, not like the one in Spiderman homecoming. In the end, infinity war will please fans and it will make them even more anxious for the next avengers movie. Watch out at the end, maybe you'll cry.",2018-04-28,8,8,3,5,English

291,Radursm,"Not everything that glitters is gold! I’d say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.The last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.Yes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.But the ""Avengers"" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.“Infinity War” is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.I quote a friend: What's the fool, the one who wrote the screenplay or the one who laughed at the jokes of the ""Guardians of Galaxy""?",2018-05-03,1,22,8,14,English

The film's humor, special effects, performances and soundtrack all make for decent mindless entertainment, but, as a film that seems to aspire to be more than that, it falls flat, largely due to some seriously glaring flaws that undermine the basic logic driving its narrative. That fundamental shortcoming, combined with an inadequate back story (essential for a complex, multifaceted story such as this) and a conclusion that assures a sequel to resolve what was left undone here (keeping the film from standing alone), undercuts this offering's other strengths.

293,he110me,"I'll start with the positives. The Effects, acting, and choreography (with the exception of one fight) were all top notch. The actors, animators, and supporting staff should be commended for a job well done. Where this movie falls flat is the writing. If there's one good thing about this movie's writing, it's Thanos. He's one of the few MCU villains who is driven by what he believes is right instead of greed, and comes off as very relatable. He also presents an interesting philosophical dilemma which gives his actions meaning. It's the rest of the writing that falls flat. Spoilers begin now.There are a lot of things I thought were done poorly. Hulk decides to not be able to transform for no apparent reason other than the plot demands it. The wakandans decide to sacrifice tons of lives in a brutal battle in order to save one non-wakandan life (Vision), when the safer route would have been to destroy vision and the stone the moment he volunteers, all because the plot demands it. Stark, after getting his ass kicked by a couple lackeys, decides it's a good idea to engage Thanos directly. Stark also completely 180s on his fatherly need to keep Parker out of trouble because the plot demands it. Thanos is established to have reality-bending powers once he gets the Reality Stone, yet he completely forgets about them the moment the rest of the characters show up to fight him because the plot demands it. There's a fight scene where Black Widow and Okoye have a bad guy surrounded, yet the seasoned and skilled warrior Okoye decides to give up her tactical advantage by circling around and fighting the bad guy head on with Black Widow because, again, the plot demands it. However, all of these points would only drop the movie to an 8/10 in my book. The real reason I'm giving it such a low score is because of the ending. If all the characters who die unceremoniously were permanently dead, I'd be sad but not mad. It would have been a powerful ending that shatters expectations. However, one of the characters who gets whisked away is Spider Man, and guess who has a confirmed sequel slated for July 2019? That's right, everyone who died is coming back in the next avengers movie, presumably by having Captain America collect the dragon balls and make a wish to the dragon Shenron. Which means this entire movie has been pointless from a story perspective, unless we watch the next movie to see the story's conclusion.

Does ""Hollywood"" even suspect they can't sneak this political programming hornswoggle past anyone who is actually awake in the audience?

In this one, the anti-hero (or probably the true hero in the eyes of green party) acts like an intergalactic communist dictator...everything for the ""good of the people"".

312,BeastJ18,"Exciting and competent. This film brings together the last decade of Marvel movies in a mostly successful extravaganza. However, it definitely should've focussed a bit more on being a good standalone story, with some resolution and reason. Instead, this movie starts out very strong and then turns into a less satisfying build up to the next Avengers film. The visual effects, cast ensemble and direction is good, but the writing suffers because of the desire to keep the audience spending money in the future. Also a lot of the character decisions and logic are completely off. Such as, having the Time Stone and deciding not to fix some of the devastating events before it is taken away from them. This film lacks higher storytelling ability and basic intelligence. As with any Marvel movie though, it isn't without it's flaws and is not intended to be a brilliant work of art... Nevertheless, it is still extremely fun, exciting and the action is non-stop. I enjoyed the film very much and look forward to seeing backlash and conclusion for the story in MCU films ahead.",2018-04-27,7,9,3,6,English

314,getmecharles,"Visually it looks like the $200M production it is.  The story line was unfortunately weak as it romped through a buffet of characters.Thanos wins because the script says he must, not because he should, or because he had a better plan.  The good guys lose not because they they had a moral failing, they just don't ever seem to quite pull it together.  The film asks you to care about losing people, but this is Marvel - they ALWAYS come back for another episode.  The Hulk, Dr. Strange, a tech team of humans, and even Thor all swing and miss - why?  Because you MUST come back for another movie.  Why? Because DISNEY owns Marvel.I wouldn't be surprised if it takes TWO more movies for Thanos to lose and the fallen heroes to be returned.",2018-04-30,4,9,3,6,English
315,jflartner,"I have loved almost all of the MCU movies before this one, so I was VERY excited to see it this past Saturday. Unfortunately, I walked away from the theater disillusioned and disappointed.First, let me say that I laughed, teared up, and was on the edge of my seat at points during this movie. There were some genuinely awesome moments in this film that were really pleasing. The overall tone of hopelessness and despair was countered well by moments of comedy and grandeur that worked well - mostly because of all the work the previous films did setting this one up.But that is one of my first issues with the movie - it does not stand on its own. And perhaps it was never meant to, but as a movie on its own, Infinity War simply fails. Most of what makes this movie enjoyable is the 10 years of backstory I have been hugely invested in. Without that, this movie is just a shell.That is all without mentioned the fact that this movie absolutely feels like the first 3 hours of a 6 hour movie. It has a strong first act, tense second act...and then it just ends, without an ending.Thanos as a character is given a lot of screentime, but nothing the writers did made me think of him as anything other than a genocidal maniac. Thanos is just as uninteresting as a villain as superman is as a hero. Ultimate power means doing whatever you want, which is exactly what Thanos does for two and a half action packed, but inconsequential, hours.And that ending. It is intended to rock fans to their core. But the character ""deaths"" that we see are undercut by two things. First, in Thanos' own words, the 50% of the population being killed are random. Our heroes are killed by an omnipotent force at random. Not exactly tense or meaningful. Second, any fans of the MCU who engage with the franchise at any level higher than just watching the movies knows that several of the characters who have ""died"" have films either in production or under contract...while many of the characters left behind are almost finished with their time in the MCU. This does set up Avengers 4 to be VERY satisfying, with the old guard set to either die or retire to make way for the (somehow resurrected) new.But just because the whole story (Infinity War and Avengers 4) is probably going to be amazing does not mean that this movie stands on its own, or is even good.Like I said, I was pretty disappointed by Infinity War - but I'm very excited for next year when I finally get to see the ending.",2018-04-29,6,9,3,6,English
316,kiwijinxter,"It's like Transformers, but with a story intact! All the Transformers movies were epic to me, but as the sequels came, the stories got more and more lost. Not Avengers: Infinity War. As an ex-comic collector (over 15 years), I was quite well acquainted with Thanos. My biggest worry was how they were going to pull off a weird looking hulk of an alien like him and not make him look like a doofus. Pulled off they did. Thanos was convincing and menacing, but most importantly he felt ""real"". Of course, no one can fault the fantastic, solid cast in the Avengers - Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, etc. (though I missed Hawkeye) were all rock-solid and it's amazing how their characters shined through despite the very very full cast of the Marvel Universe. The action was epic - this is where it reminds me of Transformers - where the CGI was fantastic, blended well, etc. The difference? Infinity War had a rock-solid story that tied in all the characters really well, and it had a whole raft of emotions - funny, sad, poignant, shocking, surprising, mindblowing moments all came through the movie. It is one truly epic movie that deserves to be on the big screen. I love it, and can't wait for the next part. Highly, highly recommended.",2018-05-01,9,6,2,4,English

And Thanos truly lives up to the title as one of the biggest and baddest villains the MCU has ever faced. The Russo brothers do an excellent job of balancing the right amount of comedy and action, and staying true to some heroes quirkiness and heroism. All the action and massive scale fights are awesome and breath taking. And an absolute spectacle and marvel that must be seen to be believed.

After seeing Ragnarok and hearing all the buzz about how great this movie was, I left the theater sort of disappointed that I spent $12 to see it. That isn't to say it isn't worth watching, but I really think it is better off as a rental. The only time I was really ""wowed"" by the movie was when Thor was on screen because he has turned into an awesome character, and the after-credit scene because of what it hinted (despite the hints already being confirmed).

321,Jelani82,"I’m really mixed to positive on this one. It’s hard to explain my feelings about the movie without spoiling it, so I’ll say this: the things that this movie does well, it does it REALLY well. Thanos was great as villain (his motives, not so much), the action scenes were good, I liked most of the character interactions, there were some emotional scenes that were done well, and a few things will transpire that you won’t see coming, which was very exciting. After Thor’s last atrocious solo outing (Ragnarok), I didn’t really care much for his character but this time around, the Russo’s brought the thunder (pun intended); he was my favorite of all the Avengers in this film (even though there were some still some residual Ragnarok traits, I’m willing to forgive them). The things that it does bad, it does REALLY bad. A lot of the humor was contrived; some of those emotional/dramatic scenes were ruined by poorly timed jokes, something that Ragnarok and GotGv2 suffered from immensely. Towards the middle of the film, the scenes seemed to kind of jump all over the place but that’s just a small nitpick on my part. Certain characters were handled in a way that really bothered me, but I can’t divulge on that point without spoilers. Lastly, the ending just fell flat for me; I understand what they were trying to do with the ending and it DID work to some degree, but for everything that happened in the movie and for it to end the way it did…it just didn’t sit well with me. Overall, I thought the movie was good…the Russo Brothers are excellent directors (Winter Soldier is still, by far, my favorite MCU film) and I’m ready to see what they have in store for Avengers 4!!! 7/10",2018-04-27,7,6,2,4,English

325,SilentTactician,"I really enjoyed this movie because it took the time to make sure that all of the characters meet together, that we got an excellent background on Thanos. We felt the chaos of the Avengers, Dr. Strange, and the Guardians as they all try to come to terms with Thanos's power and meeting each other.  Although Loki died off because his character arc was complete and the Hulk has trouble being the Hulk; Thor Odinson really stepped it up and has come such a long way. Thor no longer has any family left. his homeworld is obliterated and half of his people are dead yet still, he fights. Stark watches everyone around him die hopefully believing that Dr. Strange picked the best outcome for the world. Sometimes the galaxy murder has to win. Now we are left with the OG Avengers and some other ""lucky"" survivors. I was tense the whole movie, enjoyed the complex dialog, enjoyed the characters all coming together and still acting as themselves. I enjoyed watching all the powerful female characters fight alongside their male counterparts and I thought it was good that they made this the MCU changing movie.

Now there are a TON of characters in this movie and they are all given at least a share of screen time, enough to warrant their inclusion in the movie. Each part of the movie felt important to the overall story and they've set us up very well for the second part, due out Spring of next year. I personally like it more then Age of Ultron and right about where the first movie was all those years ago. It's clear thought that the MCU is nowhere even close to slowing down.

335,Goo4you,"The term ""Avengers"" used as the title of this movie is incorrect, just like Captain America ""Civil War"" was incorrect. This is not an Avengers movie; this was Infinity War featuring The Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy. While the movie's nomenclature is just a minor derailment, the movie itself is good. Action, loads and loads of CGI bombastic action. There is a plot underneath all of it and it all steers in the right direction, but it feels less like the logical conclusion to the whole MCU and more like the midway point from a sprawling RPG. You know what I'm talking about; the heroes are closing in on stopping the villain from doing whatever evil he's about to do only for something to get in the way at the very last moment and then ""WHOOSH!"" they fail and the bad thing happens.In other words--Infinity War was basically the plot from the midway point of Final Fantasy 6. The acting was spot on, though some actors are begging to show their age (and perhaps their time is actually coming to a close in the MCU). One of the biggest standouts was actually Josh Brolin, which as everyone knows is just the voice of Thanos but combined with the really well-done CGI and emotive development of Thanos was able to make a truly powerful villain come to life. The only real gripe I have with the entire movie was the really lackluster post credit scene. I won't spoil it, but the delivery of the next thing to come left me with more questions than answers. Other than this, Avengers 4 has a really strong setup; I just hope they don't throw this all away.",2018-05-10,8,3,1,2,English

It's a come-together for all the superheroes we've come to love and stan to face a challenging threat that may literally wipe off half of the world's population, and never does it ever fail to entertain (I had some doubts about its almost two hours and a half running-time but it ended up flying by).

342,otakudbz,"Avengers: Infinity War is nothing more than Marvel's greatest achievement in its Cinematic Universe. It's incredible to see the evolution of all these movies since 2008, when Iron Man came out and was met with a favorable reception. And, as the climax of this universe that has been built up for ten years, Infinity War does not disappoint.The nineteenth movie of the MCU brings in a well-written story full of twists and shocks that'1l make superhero fans freak out at any moment. Not only this, but the entire cast was amazing, and seeing all of these heroes interacting together for the first time is something that will stay in the memory of everyone for years. At the same time, all of the action scenes are indeed memorable and jaw-dropping. However, the best thing of Infinity War's story is how it takes risks, and changes the whole ""Marvel Movies formula"". It is simply unpredictable. The whole plot has its epic, funny and jaw-dropping moments, but it also has its sad, devastating, and shocking moments. Basically, you won't be ready for the movie, even if you think you are.The entire cast was amazing, but the highlight was definitely Josh Brolin as the movie's antagonist, the Mad Titan ""Thanos"". His performance and character development are definitely the best aspect of the movie. He's menacing, dangerous, strong, but has another side of him that no one truly recognizes. To say it short: Thanos is simply the best villain in the MCU.The special effects and CGI are also spectacular, as well. There's nothing much to talk about.However, one little flaw that Avengers: Infinity War has, is its pacing. Some scenes are way too fast, and some take too much time to get complete (for example: The Battle of Wakanda). This was something inevitable, of course. Everyone expected something like this to happen in a movie with over thirty characters to focus on. But still, the pacing is definitely not the best.But anyway, Infinity War is simply the best chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as of now. It breaks boundaries, it redefines the superhero movie genre, but above all, it succeeds in being the result of a ten-year build up of multiple movies. 9.5/10.",2018-05-16,9,3,1,2,English

Not sure if it has been a full 10 years for me, but it has sure felt like it. I was very afraid going into this that the movie would be a bloated disaster that favored f quantity over quality.  I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case.    Yes, there was a lot going on, but the Russo brothers found a way to balance action and drama. I believe the pacing of this movie felt right to me for two reasons.  First, the interconnecting arcs allowed the right amount of screen time to each hero / villain. Second, Thanos as a villain had a lot of character development, which gave depth to the CGI Titan.  The acting was on par with the other films, but I also have to give a special nod to Tom Holland for acting his ass off in one of the more memorable scenes.    If you have been a marvel movie fan or just a fan in comic book movies in general, this is a most see.  I would not recommend this film to those who have not seen any of the other marvel films, as this was a “sum of its parts” creation.

366,CharlieSpice,"Ten years in the making and worth the wait.  To see the story arc finally reach this point was a genuine pleasure and overall, I found it an amazing experience and the long running time didn’t feel long enough, I wanted to see more of them.For:1. The heroes. The chance to see every MCU hero we have grown to know and love finally together in one film was priceless, and some of the unexpected meetings were genuinely funny and interesting to watch.  I particularly enjoyed Thor meeting the Guardians and Peter’s jealous reaction.2. Action and CGI. The action sequences are fantastic, well-orchestrated and the CGI looked great, everything appeared weighty and physical.3. Laughs. The comedy was used to great effect despite the gravitas of some parts of the story.4. Storyline. The gravitas was far greater than we have seen in previous MCU films and made the whole spectacle far more intense as a result.5. Thanos. He is a great antagonist, and they gave him enough back story to let us try and comprehend his reasoning for wanting to wipe out half of the universe.  His CGI was also excellent.6. What next? The ending was profound and has left me wondering how on earth they will bring back some of the characters who I didn’t expect to die.  I imagine some who’s contracts are up with the end of this film and Avengers 4 might well be out of the MCU for good, such as Loki and Heimdall for example.  The effect of having the people crumble to dust was very good and added a sense of shock and despair to the events.7. “Bring me Thanos!” Thor’s arrival in Wakanda with Rocket and Groot to turn the tide of the battle was my favourite moment.Against:1. Wakanda.  It is a preposterous location and should not have been used for the climactic final battle.  Everything concerned with it in this film and in Black Panther was a negative for the franchise.  To imagine that such a technologically advanced country could exist on earth, hidden away through all of history while the African countries around it suffered generations of war, famine and exploitation is frankly ludicrous.  The existence of Asgard is more plausible.2. The final battle.  Modern armed forces don’t line up in ranks like Napoleonic armies, they don’t stand there chanting like Zulus, and they don’t charge to meet a numerically superior force in Medieval style melee.  They would have dug in, set up layers of defensive positions, made the space between them and the enemy a no-mans-land and mowed them down as they tried to charge in.  Also, what happened to the Wakandan air power we saw in Black Panther? The alien forces seemed to have no air capability, so they could have rained down destruction on the swarming creatures.  The Wakandan also had some very nice hover vehicles to deploy their troops, what about a few hovering tanks with particle cannons?  I guess Steve, Bucky, Sam and Rhodey forgot all of their military training.Even with a couple of negatives, this film is easily a ten, and I can’t recommend this film highly enough if you are an MCU fan.  If you are not, then watch all the others first and then watch this one.  Can't wait for Avengers 4!",2018-05-11,10,3,1,2,English
367,LillDeeDee,"(I did not read the comics at all) This movie was probably one of the most ""did not expect 2 b amazing"" movie I've watched in the past 3 years. Amazing CGI scenes, good humor and decent writing - and an ending that kinda blew my mind as I never expected it to turn in this direction. 2 1/2 hours of pure fun, so many characters from so many other movies - my favourite just simply being Thanos... Idk why, but that dude is amazing! Gave the movie 10/10 - not a letdown for me... And pls ignore all these 0/10 ratings as they troll hardcore. (This is a personal opinion, there are definitely people that expected other stuff from this movie or were kinda pissed off at the ending but the heck dudes - there is a pt. 2 coming, why cry so much?",2018-05-08,10,3,1,2,English

370,IroncladChad,"After 10 years of films, we have finally reached the endgame. Every star(save a few) from every movie from Iron Man in 2008 to Black Panther earlier this year comes together in hopes of stopping the pinnacle of bad guys: Thanos and the payoff is immense, enjoyable and admittedly complicated. The scenes play out like a comic book should, with focus jumping from one group on this planet, or another group on another planet, back to another group traveling in space. My heart goes out to anyone who hasn't at bare minimum Avengers 1, 2 and Civil War, and even then you still won't know about a certain Guardians of a certain galaxy. I personally, as a fan of these characters and someone who's seen all the movies(except maybe Thor 2), wasn't too confused, but I can't vouch for everyone and the average joe would likely go nuts trying to remember everyone's powers and why they hate certain characters and why certain characters aren't on speaking terms. On one hand, I can't discourage anyone from seeing a good film, but this film should definitely come with a warning label to go watch the others one or this movie could seem like it's way too many cooks in the kitchen.Now onto the best things: Josh Brolin as Thanos absolutely owns every scene he is in, and that's no small feat when sharing screen time with Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt and many many more. He comes off less like a villain hellbent on conquering the world like a generic bad guy, but more like a man burdened with knowledge will. One can tell that care was taken when crafting just how threatening Thanos' presence is. he's huge, he speaks calmly. Thanos doesn't make demands or give orders, he tells you what you will do and how things will end, and it is so. Thanos isn't necessarily as psychotic as Loki, or as unfeeling as Ultron, but his resolve and near limitless abilities dwarf all other villains before him. you could even say the previous MCU villains where all tests, and now the Avengers have reached the final boss. The action scenes are, as expected, spectacular. The Russo brothers have shown us once again that they showcase some of the best action not only in the MCU, but perhaps of this generation. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, they managed to give us spy movie action with intense gunfights and hand-to-hand brawls that are so brutal they look like fighting game characters with infinite life bars. This movie solidly tops that grand scale of colossal destruction not just in the form of building collapsing but the characters themselves take such beatings it's nearly unbearable. This action does lend itself to a good amount of team-ups that I won't spoil, but just know that these characters can throw down and when they do, it's a sight to behold.The only real flaws I find are ones that the uninitiated would encounter. Imagine watching a season finale of a TV show after not seeing any previous episode. It sounds silly, but I really do feel that a number of critics have gone into it that way. Yes, it can feel crowded, yes you need to see at minimum 3 other films just to get this one, but at this point, the MCU is in too deep and anything that wasn't on this scale wouldn't feel satisfactory.",2018-04-29,9,3,1,2,English

381,anvi19,"AMAZING!!! As a MCU fan since the last ten years, I have to admit that this movie was the BEST among all of them.  Once I saw Infinity War, I started thinking about how this movie could introduce the fourth Avenger movie and the missing characters ( Hawkeye, Ant Man, The Wasp or even Captain Marvel (which stand-alone movie, I am definitely going to see) Also, there were lots of memorable phrases such as “Earth is closed” uttered by Iron Man, once Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian invade New York or even the classic “language” response, here said by Drax.As characters go, Thanos is the most dangerous and powerfull villain In the MCU (he throws Gamora to the bottom of an abyssm to get the SOUL stone). Sorry Loki fans. Concerning the Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord and Gamora have a lead role in this movie. As the members of the Avengers, Iron Man is ALWAYS GREAT. What I would have improved: more time to explore the Black Orders past and their origin, also why they are called lime that.So in general: Characters: 5/5Plot: 6/5Villain: 5/5Especial effects: 4.5/5Original Score: 5/5",2018-05-25,10,3,1,2,English

392,IroncladLanship,"Positives:1. VisualsI liked the visuals. The sets were nice and distinctive, the characters were well designed and distinct so I knew the differences between every character visually.2. CharactersIf you are a fan of the MCU, all of your old favorites are back from the previous movies. If you are not a fan of the MCU, the personalities of most of the characters are still charming, consistent (mostly), and realistic.3. ActingAll of the characters were believable, and the actors really good.Negatives:1. WritingPlot holes everywhere. There are many character actions and events that don't make sense and are not explained. There are many elements, plot points, and moments that go nowhere, are pointless, or are overshadowed or discarded by other elements, plot points, or moments that go nowhere or are pointless. There is a scene (and I don't count this as a spoiler) of Iron Man, Spiderman, and Dr. Strange getting into a fight started by Starlord's entourage that has no bearing on the plot and just ends in a joke. That whole scene could have been cut out of the movie and nothing would have changed (and this is why I don't consider it a spoiler). The humor doesn't rise from a situation, but rather from characters acting silly sometimes in conflict with their character.2. DensityThere is too much stuff crammed into this movie. There are so many characters and so many locations that none of them make any impact or are even focused on in any meaningful sense. Some characters don't even get their names called out at all, like Scarlet Witch. I don't think a non-marvel fan or someone who hasn't seen any of the Marvel movies in the past would ever connect with any one of these characters or even remember any of their names.3. NitpicksThe Villan's plan doesn't make sense, as there are a million better ways to achieve his goal with unlimited power.Plot points are introduced and are abandoned seconds later.Nothing is focused on.The movie bounces around from location to location with no consistency or logic.There are scenes made for the trailer, and some scenes in the trailer are never in the actual movie.The character's personalities and abilities have drastically changed from one movie to another, with no reasons given. Some characters are more powerful than they were before or have abilities they didn't have access to before. Some characters are less powerful than before or have abilities taken away without explanation.Summary:Watch this movie if you love the characters already but don't quite remember what they can do, are extremely flexible with the movie's explanations and story, and can get past the plot holes.Do not watch this movie if you want to see something well put together by a bunch of people who care about these characters, know their backstories and plots, and who try to avoid plot holes and form sensible explanations to the events in the movies. If you can't get past plot holes, or if you have a good amount of knowledge of these character's abilities, don't watch.",2018-04-29,2,34,11,23,English

Stormbreaker, Thor's new hammer, is borrowed from a storyline from 30 years ago where Odin gave a survivor of an alien race the weapon so he can have the same powers as Thor. Technically Ragnarok hasn't happened, unless you count Thor #300.  The infinity stones, or gems as they were called in the Comics were discussed in detail.

402,DefinitelyMayb,"As good as the MCU universe has been so far with its consistent formula, I think AIW is the first time when I think the film doesn't work overall. In fact, I would say its a beautiful mess. Its beautiful in terms of the cumulation of the previous 18 films where we see all (well at least most, with some key notable absentees) come together on screen to fight a certain foe, and its beautiful because there some really emotional moments between characters which many fans have come to see.However, that said, there are by far way more flaws with the film that has not been present with other MCU film. The most obvious is the pacing and the inclusion of the many subplots within the film. The film is by far a mess in terms of this, because the Russo's attempt to juggle 5-6 subplots together by ping-ponging them back and forth without much narrative thrust. The problem here is that many of the scenes become dull on second viewing because they are largely made of expositions and the traditional marvel quips. For example, one pairing of Dr Strange, Iron man and spiderman might get 15 minute screen time for a scene, before there is a massive 40-minute gap before we come back to their story. It is nauseating because there is little momentum to carry these scenes. Whilst there are many action scenes and cool bone-chilling moments such as the appearance of Thor, a lot of the action scenes felt generic and nowhere as detailed as the Airport scene in Civil War which has set the gold standard to what all MArvel action scenes should aspire to. The problem here is that theres too much CGI and the inconsistent use of it. For example, Gamora is played by Zoe Saldana in makeup but keeps talking to the main villain, Thanos who is completely CGI becomes very jarring. That said the acting in this film is by far one of the best in the series, with Gamora and Thor being key standouts. Another problem is the humor. There is almost too much humor in this film and again tonally inconsistent. At one point, our heroes are conferring how to stop the villain, but we are constantly interrupted with jokes in such a serious situation, and they are straight up not funny. The dialogue is also poor with many lines just based on exposition. Some key characters that you would expect to have a major part, become irrelevant or have a diminished role in this film. The Black Order is a bit of a letdown, despite a very promising introduction to them. Thanos is brilliantly portrayed by Josh Brolin. His relationship with Gamora is the heart of the film. There are not many surprises and the film follows the comic pretty well which robs it of the shock factor for any person faintly familiar with the comic storyline or what was predicted. At the end, AIW is an enjoyable Marvel film with most of its part, but also contains pacing and plot holes problems that other MCU films has not had since now. There is also no rewatchable value to this film, unfortunately, but that can be forgiven due to the fact it is clearly a Part 1 film of a 2 Part series.",2018-04-27,3,41,12,29,English
403,B3ckett,"This film is flawed because it succeeds in giving virtually everybody their respected onscreen time. The pace is high from start to end, but that's about it. Story-wise there is almost nothing. Just different packs of heroes doing their heroic stuff. Some fail (Iron Man/Dr. Strange), some almost scream for a spin-off (Thor/Guardians).Brolin as Thanos steals the movie. The CGI and smart framing make him look fantastic. I don't dig his motivation (prophet/ecologist/saviour). I'd much rather see the comic book thing - courting Death. This would make a lot more sense. Also - I see this as a missed ball. Making Death his motivation, Marvel would open the MCU to another level of entities - maybe for Phase 4 or 5?Yet I find it funny, that Thanos suddenly accomplished what he wished for in a matter of days, without even breaking a sweat. That was made too easy, despite occasional sacrifices on his side. Yeah. He does that in the movie.Lots of character are underused (Gamorra, Loki and Banner), some are somewhat taken back in their development (Quill acts like Guardians vol 2 never happened; hell - the whole movie almost acts like it.The movie delivers in terms of simple fun. The pace gets you through the 2,5hr long piece without the feeling of being bored. The laughs are in, the tears too. It's just as if it was just a bit too rushed on some points.

As a new chapter in the Marvel Universe, it's absolutely solid and perhaps one of my favorites thus far. This movie has one purpose: begin the process of tying loose ends, which it succeeds at wholly. Thanos is a great villain--he has a definite shade of absolute evil, but he is never depicted to truly be insane or out of touch with his humanity entirely. He's not a stupid, 1-D or 2-D villain: he is a 3-dimensional character who for some reason has convinced himself that the universe needs to ""be balanced."" It's not nearly as developed as I would have liked to have seen: he explains his motivation comes from caring about resources, but there's no personally emotional experience that effected him directly for me to believe yet that he absolutely needed to do what he did. The movie is about 3 hours, yet despite this the content, story, and pacing kept me in the whole time and I wanted more by the time it ended. Having said that, the ending is brutal and heavy so I was, actually, relieved to have some quiet to contemplate.

They do a great job in showing entertaining action sequences that will make your draw drop but also get into the stories of a few of the characters and the relationships that are made between them.

(After all, that's the old definition of a tragic hero: one who screws everything up BECAUSE of their heroic nature.) This, by contrast, comes off like someone was more interested in pushing emotional buttons than telling a story. There were some good moments of characterization and character interaction, and the actors did a good job of seeing this thing through, but seriously, Russos? You had to cram in another torture scene or another weeping-over-the-dead scene instead of, you know, explaining the sudden relationship upgrade between two characters that seems to have happened since Civil War, or what certain characters have been doing for the last couple of years? I've seen all the Marvel movies at least once, and I was still mildly confused by some things, and annoyed that other things were sped through so quickly so that the writers could get to more ANGST.May I add that this is also a very railroaded story?

The villain Thanos made by CGI is really good, more than everyone, but for me there is some moments that you can see clearly this is a visual effect. I'm a kind of dissapointed but not so much with Hulk. He is good, but too funny (and for me it seems that Hulk does not appear because they used the budget to other things).The Final... Oh, THAT FINAL. I watched lots of movies in it premiere weekend, and the audience in the most part claps for it (included The Last Jedi). It was not what happenned with Infinity War, everybody was quiet absorving the movie. Unnecessary and not-emotional deaths to very loved heroes and a ""Not a Part 1"" finale that makes you feel trash and stupped.

422,euu,"I am not a huge Marvel fan. With the exception of the first Iron Man and Winter Soldier, I think their movies are at best well made, formulaic flicks with little substance and not much style either. So I can say that I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this movie. It's definetly better than Age of Ultron and even better than the first one.Now, if you expect story and character development you will find very little here. These movies are more like All Star Games where you pretty much know who the players are and only come to watch them doing their thing. But rest assured that the movie delivers in this aspect and whoever is your favorite character, he or she will be doing something badass. The little there is in terms of story and character is centered around the antagonist, Thanos, an alien warlord driven by his autistic desire to bring balance to the Universe by killing half of it. Normally, this idiotic motivation would make the character an absolute bore but his determination with which he pursues this goal, as well as the fact that he comes off as an actual threat, makes him the best Marvel villain to date(not that the bar was set very high). By the end of the movie I was actually rooting for him, but that was mostly to watch all the characters introduced after the first Avengers die.Now, for the humour, this is a Marvel movie so expect a lot of quips and winks, some of which land, other that won't. But, like with Black Panther, the good thing about them is that they are not put in dark or serious moments. Glad to see that after 10 years, the producers of these films finally understand tone. Unfortunatelly, the action scenes are as devoid of tension as ever. Whenever a hero is in danger don't worry because another hero will save him. Also, the final battle is not only simillar with what we saw 2 months ago in Black Panther, with futuristic literal spear chuckers, but also kinda ripps off the battle at the end of the Phantom Menace, with people making energy shields formations inside a larger energy shield.Still, I did not expected the ending and even though it will probably be all fixed by the end of the second movie, I will admit the producers still had a lot of balls to pull it off. I would actually prefered if everything will end here, but there are still money to be made, so if you are a teary-eyed fanboy after the ending, fear not, there is definitely going to be a sequel. Until then, you can laugh at the next DC dumpster fire.",2018-05-01,8,4,1,3,English
423,DvorkaM,"Not a perfect movie, but only by a hair’s width. This movie is a reward for seeing all the previous MCU movies. If you missed them, you will find this movie confusing, but I think they were counting on it during development.Avengers are established, no background required. And all the exposition go to .... Villain. Finally an all around complex and proper villan I am talking disney classic villain level of villain. He makes this movie great, I actually think that he can be considered the main character of the movie and all the Avengers are the obstacles he is overcoming, not the other way around, and it works!!!So much is happening all the time but he is there in the center, like an anchoring stone around which it all revolves.That is not to diminish the humor in this movie, I can recall a joke being flat and there is lots of them. And lots of style, there is IM humor GotG humor, Spider man humor, all consistent all fitting.While I dont want to oversell it, to make somebody overxcited.

I'm surprised they didn't just have them throw stones at Thanos - who actually had a point about overpopulation. Everyone else comes across as entirely unaware, unintelligent and it is so disappointing. I expected better, much better.

429,Muskrat147,"Ah, yes, Avengers: Infinity War. The Marvel film that’s been craved by fans since the first time the Avengers assembled back in 2012. But is it any good? Yes. In fact, it’s great. A satisfying and fun adventure bringing together over 70 different heroes from the last 18 years, The Russo Brothers’ first of two brain-children has everything you might expect - popcorn-friendly action, witty dialogue, and an epic, character-driven story. But, what Infinity War includes throughout its story that many modern blockbusters lack - emotion - is what’s truly amazing. For the first time in years, the characters and their decisions have emotional weight to them. Their relationships with one another, including their interactions, have more meaning this time around, which is incredibly refreshing. This is in part because of Thanos, who is now easily the best villain in the MCU. The writing for his character is clever and powerful, and still manages to include the one liners and actions that only the baddest of baddies can pull off. The depth in which his backstory is explored is surprising, and definitely elevated the experience. With all of this said, though, it’s not a perfect film. The editing between the many locations is slightly out of control and messy, especially within the first half-hour. Some of the characters’ actions and decisions feel contrived, mostly for an emotional twist or moment. Also, the clashing of tones between the different locations and groups of Avengers feel odd and, again, messy. But these issues don’t ruin the film at all, and, honestly, are forgettable once the third act begins. The expansive set-pieces that make up the finale are immensely satisfying to watch, and the ending, though a bit bizarre, brilliantly sets up for the sequel. The performances throughout are terrific, and not one actor can be pinpointed as the best. All of the actors are firing on all cylinders, and the emotional moments work solely because of them. All in all, Infinity War is the most surprising and satisfying film so far this year, and arguably, as of now, the best story told in the MCU. If only 2019 could come sooner...",2018-05-06,8,4,1,3,English
430,TheFreeman148,"Let me start off by saying i really enjoyed this movie.  The comedy was some of the best they have, the action scenes are tremendous, and the CGI especially with Thanos is some of the best I have ever seen in a movie.  But, what really took my rating down from a 9/10 to a 8/10 was the ending.  No i'm not upset over these lovable characters ""dying"" but how it was gone about.  There was one moment when Tony Stark was stabbed by Thanos which made me (along with every single person in the theater) gasp and have their hands over their mouth.  It was a huge shock and had me absolutely gripped but, that feeling and those emotions were immedietely washed away right after when Tony simply just healed himself. Its these little fake out moments that kind of took me out of the moment and stripped me of that emotion. Certain characters that were ""killed"" already have sequels in the works *cough* Guardians *cough* so it made the ending have a lot less weight to it and kind of had me shaking my head in confusion.  However this is actually good in the long run because they saved the OG crew for the sequel so we could have more time with them alone.  Great movie but, could've pushed the envelope of emotions a little further. A must see for Marvel fans",2018-04-30,8,4,1,3,English

It works well in the Cinematic Universe in the sense, but unfortunately as a solo movie it lacks in character, Thanos was the only presence that actually got something as a character, the rest were there too simply fight against him. Mark Rufallo has a great performance along with Robert Downey Junior and Josh Brolin.I have to give the Russo brothers a lot of props with this movie, it would be easy to lose sense of it and not give characters the amount of screen time that they need, but they did it well, even with all of those characters in the movie.",2018-04-29,8,4,1,3,English
433,MonkiReviews,"This is my new favorite Marvel movie. The reason I think it works so well is because of the risks, story, and acting. The special effects made everything look very real too. The movie takes many risks, but I won’t say any because I think you would want to watch the movie first. The actors were amazing. Each character fits their part. It makes it so it’s hard to imagine anyone else playing them, they are that good. The story is what makes the movie the best Marvel movie yet. They added a great villain, Thanos is a real threat to everyone. In the previous Avengers I think the villains weren’t as theatening (Loki and Ultron). The movie is set in many different areas of our world and beyond, which I think is exciting because we get to see new and returning places like never before. The beginning of the movie is action packed and exciting enough to keep my attention. The middle is even better. They fit the characters in with each other and it doesn’t take away from the movie. The middle has a lot of great storytelling and action. The ending was the best part though. They wrapped up the movie and I still wanted more. They had epic fights, while the story kept on going and didn’t slow down. The movie was two and a half hours and I still wanted to see more. That says a lot about how much I liked it. I completely recommend this movie to everyone!",2018-05-05,10,4,1,3,English

Kill half the life in the universe to make the lights stay on a bit longer. If Thanos was a smoker and drinker he'd be nursing one drink and taking slow puffs on one cigar to last him all night.

443,Hunterjw,"Infinity War is an incredible culmination of the past ten years of Marvel films. It's an event film of the grandest scale, brought to life by these characters we've gotten to know. Of course, it's recommended you do watch the prior films for the best understanding of the plot. But enough on the past. The film is a visual spectacle with heartracing action, genuine emotion, and occasional moments of hilarious levity. The chemistry of previously unpaired heroes is astounding, with Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch melding together seemlessly. Chris Hemsworth truly owns the film, continuing his recent hot streak from Thor Ragnarok. I will admit that the focus on Chris Evans and his group was a bit thin and too far between, but hopefully they'll receive ample screentime in Avengers 4, mostly to give the actor a proper sendoff from Captain America. But Josh Brolin's Thanos STEALS THE SHOW. A cruel, menacing monster of epic proportions, his complexity and thought process for his decisions is fascinating, as his reasoning for his plan can be slightly justified, while still being wholly wrong. Though I can say I loved the film, it should be acknowledged that it's still very much a part 1 film and opinions will likely change when Avengers 4 comes out. But until then, I can say this was a massive success once again for Marvel.",2018-05-17,9,4,1,3,English

If you understand that it was just a popcorn flick for teenagers, then that's cool because that is all it is.I honestly don't know where to start.Thanos was ok, i like Brolin. It was quite clever to cast him as a hybrid vader/joker but with a larger chin. There are no deep psychological aspects to take from him, it's a movie for teens, not a psychological thriller. Maybe he was mirroring the thoughts of our own human masters... whoooohooo.The cinematography or whatever it is called now in the fight scenes was abysmal, the fights didn't matter, no-one cared.

Cheese ruins who you care about, who lives or dies ect and it was plentiful.Lazy writing, my pet hate. Someone threw a big box of marvel plushies onto the screen and expected it to be more than 'giving the kids what they want', what a mess.The best bit about lazy writing is that the sequel is now so open ended that it could just be all a dream or maybe some contrived space/time (make it up as you go along) rubbish.The plot had no substance or intrinsic nature, there was something about a magic glove.It doesn't matter though kids and neckbeards. your favourite characters are in it and because it's made by 'you know who', ther'll be toys and franchising aplenty,",2018-08-02,4,5,1,4,English

Yes, admittedly this wasn't the end-all and be-all I was anticipating, and co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo have made far better, more sophisticated, and entertaining Marvel films than this. But, again, I greatly enjoyed this. The action is good fun, the effects are top notch, and Josh Brolin proves once again that he's an absolute master of his craft. But I also just couldn't help but feel as though this was a bit too obvious of an extended trailer for another movie to come, rather than its own contained story. There's so much telegraphed by this film's story that left me feeling cold, not necessarily because of the events that occur, but more so because of the idea that the powers-that-be actually felt that the audience would take what happens in this movie as gospel, when in reality it ends up feeling like a bit of a cinematic bluff. It feels a bit too much like the first half or two-thirds of a movie, rather than its own thing. And having a ""part one"" and ""part two"" film combo isn't necessarily unheard of, but why couldn't the alternative have happened? Why couldn't we get one complete, epic, three-and-a-half hour plus narrative in one cinematic sitting? You can't make the argument that no one would see it, due to the fact that we've had 10 years and 20 Marvel movies pointing to the contrary. People would've seen it, no matter what, so why not do it? Two movies would make more money? Probably, but I digress, I suppose. Again, I know it might sound as though I'm tearing the movie apart, but I did enjoy it quite a bit overall, despite the fact that it ended up feeling a little too much like -- an albeit much better version of -- a ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1,"" or a ""The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug,"" or a ""Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1.""",2018-04-28,8,5,1,4,English

It's a movie that:-its cast features some 30-40 (!!!) main and secondary characters, yet everyone gets their fair share of screen-time.-its plot consists of 4-5 parallel sub-stories yet it somehow doesn't confuse the viewer (or at least, not as much as someone would expect to happen with so many story threads).-direction (courtesy of the Russo bros) is one of the best ever in an MCU movie.-the villain is a vicious mass murderer who, in a humanly manner, cries so wonderfully you won't believe it.I could go on and on, pointing out many aspects of this wonderful movie, but I'd end up spoiling it.My only gripe is that Infinity War's story is a big cliffhunger and it doesn't resolve much by the time the end credits roll.

The story is absolutely **** insane and has no logic in it whatsoever, the jokes are cringeworthy and Rocket Raccoon was the only thing that was actually funny, the action is even more cringeworthy, especially when the protagonists are battling in Wakanda and out of nowhere a deadly lawnmower comes and kills every enemy, and, sadly, the acting is terrible. Now, don't get me wrong, Josh Brolin does his best, and he wasn't terrible, it's just that Thanos isn't compelling at all and when it truly comes down to it he is just a blob of walking CGI who happens to have some sympathetic moments. This isn't because of Brolin's acting, but rather because of the direction and writing. Chris Pratt, Batista and Bradley Cooper do a good job as well, but Gamora became annoying in this film, and it didn't feel like they intended to do so. Overall, worst MCU film so far.

481,ScienceAdvisor,"I will keep this one short.  While the movie is playing, you will be drawn in, fully engaged and entertained.  A few plot holes will register, but the frenetic pace will make you put them aside.  At least until it is over.  Once that happens however, you will be tested.  Are you someone that checks their brains at the door and can just enjoy the movie, forgetting everything you saw and just remembering the experience.  Or are you someone that remembers almost everything you saw, and cannot help but tally up the 25+ plot holes (at least 10 are major), that are buried in this movie.  Normally, that would be the death knell of any movie, but as you can see from my score, it still manages to be quite watchable.  Just not the glowing praise that many would give it.As for the writers explanation that Thanos did not do a specific thing (no spoilers) due to him ""not wanting to"", is laughable.  That is an excuse, not a reason.",2018-08-01,7,6,1,5,English

490,Tha_Lowkey_One,Great movie from start to finish a must watch in IMAX or IMAX 3D watching this one in a standard theater will not do it justice. A darker tone than the other movies but the tone is broken up by properly placed comedic lines so that is not overly dark. Thanos is a bad ass and rivals Heath Ledgers joker as one of the best villains brought to the big screen. I loved every scene with Thanos. I don't agree with the reviews that say there is no character development. These characters have been developed for 10 years which is what makes this movie so great. Somehow they managed to give every character their time to shine and it didn't feel forced. Are there some plot holes yes of course are their some mistakes most definitely but as super hero films go they don't get much better than this.,2018-04-27,10,7,1,6,English
491,Sick_Puppy,"I can only think the bad reviewers are DC butt hurt fans who have to live with their  justice league  movie (which in dont hate ) but after watching this you just can but imagine the shame they feel after comparing these two. Infinity war is not perfect but its amazing. Its an awesome reward for those who have been following the marvel saga. It has been made for those who watched all the movies because the characters have been built for these moment in their stand alone movies. If you havent watched them and expect not to be confused or overwhelmed you are wrong, this is not a stand alone movie. The level of difficulty of  putting together that many characters in a balanced ,funny, action packed movie is really high and its really well done. It is at a scale that has never been seen before. Im giving it a 10 because al the haters giving 0 ratings and the effort and love it has been put into this movie.  But there are two major plot points that keep me from giving it a perfect score in my head :  SPOILERS AHEAD.......1. The relationship between Thanos and Gamora should have been built better, it should have started in the Guardians of the Galaxy films so it was more believable and impactful. 2. The guantlet removal scene with Iron man and Spidey while  Star lord  has his chat and have his reaction is just stupid and a big downer in my opinion , felt so staged and forced.  And 3, just for my own fan service, not a complaint but fight between Thor and Thanos should have been longer, or let us see the first one on the ship.",2018-04-28,10,7,1,6,English
492,Braquiador55,"The first Avenger movie, was okay. The second one, Age of Ultron, **** awful. Now here we are, he third one, the catharsis of EVERYTHING that the MCU has built up till this momment. And, quite honestly, they did a **** great job. I mean, it's the Russo brothers, they know how to handle a super production. But this was a whole other level. This was THE biggest super production probably ever. And they pulled it off. They **** did it. The action iss superb, Russo brothers house brand; the OST is incredible, almost never using the cheap trick of the Avengers theme (like Age of Ultron), but still being able to put together such a superb OST at the same level of those composed by Hans Zimmer for DC, is truly an achivement. It may cheat a little bit based on the fact that characteer development is carrried out in the other Marvel movies, but at the same time it's a universe at the end of the day, so everything is connected, which makes the fact that there's little character development (apart from Thanos, which I will discuss in a second) not a flaw, but a strenght so that it can let the movie flow at a greeat pace.Now let talk Thanos. Marvel, and DC, have never beeen able to pull off a great villain in the movies, that was until now. Thanos is a good villain, a pretty good one even by the industry's standard. It has emotions, real and credible ones. And he isn't evil. I mean, his actions aren't the best  and his plan is quite extreme, but in the end he's doing it all for the saake of the universe and prosperity of all races.This movie was, for the first time, everything that I expected. Don't know how the Russo brothers are going to top this with the next Avenger movie. but for now we're left with a great movie with the honor of being called the best Marvel movie (next to Logan).",2018-04-30,9,7,1,6,English
493,OscarAdcock,"I’d go as far to say that i hated both Avengers Assemble and Age Of Ultron. They were trashy punch fests with no real story to them, and Infinity War is still a punch fest but there’s now much needed weight behind them. This movie was so enjoyable because you saw 10 whole years of character development and plot unfold before your eyes. The special effects were great, there was real emotion and bonding between the characters ands it actually mixed up the formula a bit. Please see this film if you haven’t already just for the ending alone.",2018-04-29,6,7,1,6,English
494,mic413,"Avengers:Infinity War is the culmination of several years of Marvel assembling earth's mightiest heroes. As such, the movie is founded on the MCU and moviegoers having not watched the preceding titles may struggle to keep pace with the plot and lack the levels of character attachment necessary to fully appreciate the experience. There are essentially 4 arcs that take place concurrently and begin to intertwine as the movie progresses. These subplots capture an amicable balance of wit and drama with exhilarating action scenes, the first of which I found particularly impressive. There are, however, two main criticisms that I have of the movie, each related to the plot (Disclaimer: I have not read the comics and am not familiar with the arc): firstly, there is a very inconsistent use of logic in both the heroes' decision-making and use of their powers. Secondly, the focus on Thanos to build a sense of what a powerful adversary he is was somewhat overdone (This could have easily been a Thanos-titled movie) and his brutal/merciful nature is more inconsistent rather than giving a sense of his inner turmoil. Each of these left me perplexed and frustrated after viewing the entire movie. An additional, personal criticism that I have is the MCU's new quest to make Tom Holland's Spider-man an over-zealous and non-intellectual Stark fanboy - I reduced my score for this movie by a point because I can't condone this. The movie's best feature, in my opinion, is its visuals. Having watched it in IMAX 3D, I can vouch for the fact that it is, indeed, a visual spectacle to behold. The acting is also of the highest order and engrosses the viewer, allowing some to overlook the faults I've mentioned (particularly while viewing) - and definitely making it a worthwhile to watch while it is screening in theater.",2018-05-09,6,7,1,6,English

498,itsmarcus2017,"If Thanos is out of his mind, so are the minds of the screenwriters of this film. They try to make sense out of Thano’s mad “Kill Half” theory. They even tried to add some humanity to this psycho sociopath. He has half of the universe’s blood on his hands, but he also has a heart? What? This is the definition of insane. I guess the screenwriters went crazy after the Marvel executives said “you can kill anyone” in Infinity War. So they tried to find ways to torture the audience and kill as many main characters as they can. I felt like I was watching a horror movie and waiting for getting PTSD. The campy and melodramatic killings – boyfriend killing girlfriend, girlfriend killing boyfriend, and father killing daughter really threw me off. It’s very dramatic, and it works to make an emotional impact on the audience. But in my perspective, to execute characters in a deliberately rapid manner, while torturing the audience and making them mourn, it’s atrocious, cold-blooded, manipulative, and low-quality writing. There is more to bear than to enjoy when watching the movie.Marvel just does not know when to stop making jokes. Making fun in Infinity War will only make people do not know how to feel happiness and sadness. I did laugh while they were having a bit fun. But it felt so wrong, we just lost somebody not long ago. The audience next to me even laughed while crying and looked ridiculous. I think Marvel had internal screenings but I am appalled by this apparently poor narrative design. I completely understand they do not want a serious tone throughout the running time, but changing the scene and adding a joke after ending a character’s life do not help ease the intense atmosphere. The lack of running time in Infinity War makes it very hectic, messy when progressing the story. Some leading roles were even made out to be like side characters. The Captain America team and the Black Panther team suffered from very short screen time. Except fighting the characters had no time for feelings, those who had the chance to share strong sentiments were Thor and Gamora. The audience had a glance of everything but left with much more questions and desire.There is no point to discuss who got killed in Infinity War, because some characters with confirmed sequels got killed, which does not make sense. And viewers can immediately predict what will happen in the next film.Infinity War is so awful that it is the worst in MCU. I do not appreciate its story design, character development and interactions, and its insensitivity to the audience’s emotions. A majority of the film tortures and kills many favorite superheroes of the fans – it’s not well-intentioned, and it’s not entertainment. I can’t see the point of this film. Well, the visuals are still the brighter side of this film – the cinematics featuring many beautiful sceneries and details, and the heroes featuring new tactics and moves. But they seem not worthy of overcompliments. What’s wrong with you, Marvel? It’s not fun when you treat the heroes like that!",2018-04-27,3,90,12,78,English

Stupid movie. The battle in Wakanda is just the battle from Star Wars Episode 1.  I even yelled out ""starting up da shield"".  The bad guys had tunneling machines to go under the shield yet choose to sacrifice hundreds of dog things needlessly into the shield.  Dr. Strange could made a portal around Thanos' hand and cut the glove/arm right off him, villain beaten, OR rewind time since he's the master of it with his stone.  Hulk turned into a MASSIVE WUSS.

My biggest beef was that they did not follow the comics at all in terms of why Thanos invaded earth and wanted to take the Infinity stones- to impress death and they screwed that up with a lame theory of overpopulation. Also the beginning made zero sense no intro no structure whatsoever. Well it was better than Ultron at least. Also wtf was the Black Order so weak in the film? How come Dr. Strange was weak?

So it kind of ruins that whole ending when they've already announced sequels and the cast members to go along with them. So what was the point in killing all of them off when nearly all of them are coming back? It makes no sense and it kind of ruined the movie, which honestly was rather so-so.There were a few funny bits with the Guardians, Dr Strange and Tony.

It succeeds in providing an exhilarating, emotional, and excellent filmgoing experience. Thanos is the best villain in the MCU no doubt, the time and attention given to his character and motivations is worth the 10 year buildup. My only flaws with this film are the somewhat forced relationships between characters and motivations and the film's ""part 1"" nature.

518,MouthofSauron,"Avengers: Infinity War's heart is the Mad Titan Thanos, who provides the greatest emotional highs and lows in the film. The narrative is relatively straightforward (the Avengers &amp; co. must stop Thanos from acquiring all the Infinity Stones) and never once does the film seem to drag, a miracle given the number of characters involved. I have two main criticisms of the film: first, I found many characters to be underutilized (Black Panther, Steve Rodgers, Bruce Banner, among others), and second, I thought the entire subplot of Thor crafting his new weapon to defeat Thanos to be trite and silly (giant Peter Dinklage did not help). I was not a fan of some of the strange tonal shifts throughout the film. However, despite its flaws, IW is a very entertaining movie that pretty much any fan of the superhero genre will enjoy.

I didn't know what to expect honestly and yet I walked out of the theatre dumbfounded at just how satisfied I was with the acting, plot, and most importantly how all the characters were written. This is literally the best comic book movie ever made. The amount of emotions going through me for 3 hours was insane!! This is not a standalone film but a culmination of 10 years of growing up with these characters where every character has a certain liking and depth to them that the viewer holds before they appear in the movie.

However, after ""Age of Ultron"" disappointed me (even though I still enjoyed it), I didn't want to get my expectations too high for this because I didn't want to be let-down. Thankfully, I wasn't. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" has it all: high-stakes action, emotion, visual splendor, great acting and cinematography, and a script that thankfully never loses focus, even though it's focusing in on a large group of characters. Even as someone that hasn't seen every MCU film, I felt like I could follow this one very easily.

526,bfoore90,"Easily the best of the Avenger films, took risks and had alot of surprises. I found it as a whole to be better than Black Panther but falls short of Thor Ragnarok. With that being said, Thanos is a pure force of biblical proportion and he easily carries the movie just based on his screen presence. This film is not without its issues, firstly theres a ton of exposition, mostly for those who probably hadn't seen all of the Marvel movies. There are alot of characters in this film, alot of things going on and it's easy to find yourself lost by the storylines and subplots as they weave together. Some of the characters, most notably Thor and Peter Quill lack proper development from previous movies as they gain powers from the movies but proceed not to use them. The biggest problem I have with the movie involves late on the movie where there are some opportunities to stop Thanos, but because of stupidity and selfishness of certain characters they fail which results in the deaths of millions.

I honestly loved it. If I didn’t have work tomorrow I would have gone straight back in the theatre and watched it again. 10/10 from me.",2018-04-29,10,2,0,2,English

547,MallRat15,Wow this movie truly exceeded my expectations in every way possible. Best villain in a marvel movie to date and in my opinion the best MCU movie ever. Even though there is a long run time I never felt my self bored. There is a lot going on with many different story lines but never felt my self lost. There are also many funny jokes in this movie that always hit the mark.

Besides the first encounter with Thanos on the Asgardian spacecraft, the conflicts are not strong nor captivating. Visually, the CG are good.  Standard Marvel level, which makes this a good popcorn movie.Acting-wise, not everything is trying to act here so you do not see in-depth acting chops except some occasional cheesy one-liners.All in all, is it a good Marvel popcorn movie?

566,TheQuietGamer,"Can we just take a second to appreciate the sheer scale of this movie? Infinity War wastes no time getting started as the opening moments show Thanos having already begun his assault on the MCU. I wonder if this was actually the best move. I love how the movie goes nonstop, but the way the initial slaughter is handled cheapens the death of some of the MCU's more memorable side-characters. These moments are meant to establish Thanos as the baddest dude in the galaxy right off the bat, but we already knew that going into the movie. A brief bit of buildup would have gone a long way as the beginning of the film just feels like shock value.Things get better from there though. I love how Marvel brought together all these moving pieces from their catalog of films without sacrificing the unique feeling each of them has in their own standalone entries. Almost every hero they have made it into the movie. They're not all onscreen at once. Instead Infinity War splits them up in several different teams of cross-overs that effectively make the fight feel so incredibly large. It really sells the desperation inherent to the conflict at hand when everybody is going to such great lengths of finding their own ways to combat Thanos from so many different angles. You get a pretty nice picture of just how big the MCU currently is.The action is phenomenal. The battles are huge and intense. Even the henchmen of Thanos provide a nice challenge for these veteran superheroes. As cool as it is to see the big bad's help prove to be a threat as well, it's a little disappointing that they are involved in so much of what's going on. With Thanos off collecting the last of the infinity stones, these guys (and gal) are who The Avengers spend most of their time fighting. These are some knock down, drag out fights that are cool to watch, but these are also some lame side-villains. They're so faceless that the movie itself only bothers to tell us one of their names.As for Thanos himself the big question is whether or not he fixes Marvel's villain problem. The answer is only partially. For the first time in the MCU we are given a villain that proves to be a real danger to these characters. There are actual stakes this time around and we know that some of these heroes might never come back. This imbues the movie with a sense of tension no superhero film has ever had before. Infinity War tries to make Thanos deeper than any of the foes before him as well. That's where the disappointment sets in. The scenes where they try to show him as a more conflicted villain with an emotional center fall flat as this is the first time we've ever really spent time with him. His socioeconomic motives are interesting, but we still aren't able to feel his motivations on a personal level. So really what makes him so memorable isn't what's going on in his head or heart. It's literally just that he's a powerhouse who spills the blood of those we've come to care about. In the end is he one of the better Marvel villains? Most definitely. The best? Not at all.That long teased Infinity War has finally begun and is remarkable due to how huge it is. This might just be the most ambitious thing to ever hit the big-screen in terms of scope. The way it juggles all these different characters and places them all onscreen in one film while keeping their distinctive qualities intact is it's greatest achievement. The characters we love have finally come face to face with an antagonist that can and does do some real damage to their lives and universe. While Thanos is ultimately kind of bland it's nice to know that he can at least shake things up in surprising ways that keep us on our toes and have us dying to know what is coming next for the MCU. The ending is the most bold thing Marvel has done with their cinematic universe thus far. It's only slightly cheapened by the fact that we know things will likely be reversed in the way we expect, but until then things are looking pretty bleak for the world's mightiest heroes. This is a must watch for anyone who has ever followed the stories up to this point. There are just some issues that have kept it from reaching it's fullest potential.",2018-05-19,7,0,0,0,English

This movie depends on the audience having kept up with the previous MCU movies. Movie-goers who have not done so will find the movie confusing and shallow as the movie does not provide any background for any character with the exception of the villain. It is also pretty-much non-stop action from beginning to end which some movie-goers may find nauseating (although I do wonder why these people bother to watch any MCU films in that case). The film does have quite a bit of humor inter-spaced with the non-stop action. That being said, some of the plot could have been more robust in the earlier part of the film, but then again you're watching a super-hero movie.

592,Ken_Heisenberg,"The movie is a great entertainment. Action and cast is spot on with only one weak spot - plot and the character performance of Dr Strange, Hulk and Vision. First of all, Hulk's role in the movie is reduced only to the beginning, where he loses. He is of no use in all other battles. Second is the massive let down by Dr Strange, when he never makes use of his greatest power - time stone. Previously he was able to defeat any opponent including the destroyer of worlds, and now he cannot even defeat 1 guy, despite having the power to go back in time and see the future. And why on earth did he give up the stone when he could simply erase the fight altogether or at least trap Thanos in another dimension?! Thanos with no knowledge about mystic arts would be trapped there forever. Once he gives up the stone to Thanos, it's all over because Avengers would have to not only defeat Thanos, but to kill him instantly so he cannot go back in time (or at least cut off his arm instantly). Also Vision, being one of the most difficult heroes to fight against, is not able to use his powers in any meaninful way.

Thanos is a complicated villain that has both moments of badassery and heart. His drive to complete his objective captures our attention and make heroes' struggle very meaningful unlike most other movies. There is not a single wasted scene in the entire movie, each serves the move the plot, which in turn makes the movie feel very rich in content. I do not like to say any further, as i think i spoke enough about the quality of this movie. I'll not speak to marvel fans because i know they watched it and loved it. However, even if you are not a fan, if you watched enough marvel movies that you kinda feel interested in the whole arc, this movie is everything you could possibly expect from it.

Infinity Stones they call it, we, antics to step upon, or more accurately to sacrifice upon. This game of chess is as fun as it would be to watch one. With sacrifices subsequently dashing across the herd of multiple plots, the textbook 1-0-1 tricks of chess, is their way in. A pawn for a pawn and a Queen for a pawn, taking heavy awe-gasping non-affordable losses, Earth's mightiest heroes, has that one emotional punch left in their bags, which works every time despite of your awareness of its manipulative nature.After going through a great deal of chapters, their magic trick wasn't the disappearance of your favourite face cards but the build up or the origin of their construction that led us here, THIS works because THAT did, Downey regretted his actions (Favreau's Iron Man) and made mistakes (Whedon's Age Of Ultron), that is why the birth of his gadgets and attitude towards this alienated phenomenon touched the ultimate membership of the rare 2 billion club. The writing is incredibly inspiring when it comes to blend in these many characters- which hasn't been done to this scale, although Soderberg's smoothness is yet impenetrable- but unfortunately it is also the one with the most mistakes, where you can clearly see that they sew in the missing links with poor cloth material later on in the production and called it ""improvisation""- humor is not that necessary, especially the off putting references that disenchants the viewers from this mythology.To be fair, even the structure of the film is above the safe formulaic method of MCU, with Josh Brolin at the centre of the narration, his invasion in each act of our heroes ""turns the leg to jelly"" and keeps the urgency alive and vulnerability, turned to 11, that you feel as he picks up each of our beloved caped saviour in the air, where the contrast of the power he oozes is impeccably nobel.

The Russo Brothers here sign a masterpiece following the Marvel formula. The movie isn't perfect because we find the same problems every single Marvel and this movie doesn't leave it. Problems of green screens, too much CGI or even too much humor. This movie sometimes looks like a patchwork of stories put together with a lot of shortcuts. However this movie brings me the Marvel touch, the dream that it is supposed to bring, through emotion and memorable scenes. This movie represents such an interesting way to restart the MCU and it lightens my fan's torch.Thanos is without any doubt the best villain of the MCU and brings a real bonus in the movie.

651,Maddie_1003,"Avergers: Infinity War is a culmination of Marvel Superheroes from the MCU, and this is by far, my favourite. The Russo brothers did a fantastic job of holding the audience's attention till the end credits and manged to provide a cliffhanger there too. It HAS lived up to the hype. The story, as most of you will know, is about the mightiest villain Thanos, who is invading planets from the existing universe in search of Infinity Stones, a set of extremely powerful gems which will help Thanos being all-powerful. It is up to the Avengers to protect them and if possible, take them from Thanos.The action sequences: Larger than life will be an understatement. Watching in 3D is the most amazing experience one can have. Every time, the action offers something new. Every Marvel superhero has their signature style, with hyped features and fight sequences. It is a joy to watch that onscreen. But, Infinity War is not just about actions, it has emotions, and comedy sprinkled in too. That's what makes it stand out from the rest.That being said, handling a movie with so many superheroes, which stretches for more than 2 hours, has not been divided proportionately. Iron Man and Dr.Strange get the lion's share, next is Thor and the Guardians. Hulk is a surprise and gem. Watch, you'll understand. Although, we hardly see Black Panther, Bucky Barnes, Falcon and Black Widow kick some villains, barring 1 scene. But, I'm still OK with it.The ending left me like, ""I've to wait till 2019 now??""",2018-05-04,9,0,0,0,English
652,MasonOcker,"I find that Infinity War triumphs by a margin that surprised even me, by presenting interesting ways to display character interaction and growth throughout the movie.The film's biggest success comes with the character of Thanos. Despite Thanos' villainous nature combined with his seemingly absurd scheme, the people behind this movie's development nearly pulled off the impossible by making him an empathetic character from most audiences. Sure, his plan to eradicate half of all living people is maniacal, but the way they presented his reasoning behind it made it genuinely understandable. His plight with his daughter Gamora was not necessarily heart-wrenching, but it felt raw and real. The backstory they presented made him feel like the protagonist of the story, and you really grow to like him not only as a villain, but as a character.In correlation with this, the writing for this film felt impeccable for the mere fact that despite needing to show dozens of characters at once, no characters felt left out or unnecessary. This comes from the brilliant tactic used in this film to focus on a few subgroups of characters instead of entirely separately or together. This works wonders with this movie, as we can keep focus on every aspect of the characters' hardships, while also being able to believe that they truly are doing everything they can to take Thanos down in the most direct and intellectual ways. This sharing of screen-time to all characters really made it feel epic, which correlates into the movies climax perfectly.Finally, this movie works great as a general action flick, which to many can be a great selling point. Sure, there's plenty of exposition and dramatic stakes, but the fight scenes that take place throughout are exhilarating and keep you engaged. Coinciding with this, the CGI throughout didn't feel distracting in any way.Not much about this movie fails, but I would say I am peeved with the pacing of certain scenes concerning the comedy. The humor is quite good, but occasionally it can feel strange or unneeded. I wouldn't say the comedic aspects of this movie are bad, just rather that they occasionally felt tacked onto the script after it had been established. Not a movie-killer, but it may irk some viewers like it did to me, as it can confuse the tone of a scene.On the same pedestal, the introduction of the soul stone in this film felt very lackluster compared to speculation among the community. Not gonna lie, people had better ways of implementation than the canon one.I wouldn't say it's perfect, but this film does way too much right for me to ignore its obvious impact on recent culture, and its likability. A score of a 9 shows just how great a superhero movie can be, despite focusing on different aspects from the stereotypical ones. If you somehow haven't seen this movie, I'd give it a recommendation just because of how unique and marvelously executed it is.",2018-05-18,9,0,0,0,English
654,ViceGuy1997,"I was so afraid that huge expectations will left me disappointed with this movie. I'm glad it didn't happen. Not even close. Infinity War with a doubt is one of the best comic book movies ever made and for me, it's the most favourite MCU movie by far. Story, humor, visuals, action - all is done on high-level. Thanos is the best comic book villain and for me, he's on the same level with Heath Ledger's The Joker. I really hope Avengers 4 will live up to the quality of this movie.",2018-05-19,10,0,0,0,English
655,OwenMansell,"With all 18 MCU film been leading up to infinity war, this film did not disappoint. The humour was a light hearted and similar to other marvel movies but the film didn't have that tone throughout. There were some scenes such as the death of half the cast (especially spider man) that made me very shocked and almost wretched as you get an attachment to all these characters during the buildup to this film. But with films like ant man and the wasp coming out and rumoured films like spider man homecoming 2 and black panther 2, this almost gets rid of the sorrow you feel when they die. But it ends with a very good plot twist when you see the logo for captain marvel at the end.",2018-05-25,9,0,0,0,English
656,Tassarinian,"To be honest, I don't really understand the hype for this particular movie, I could name at least three, or even four MCU movies that in my opinion were much better. This felt like a very long prelude to Infinity War Part II, not a standalone movie. CGI fest of beating, beating, battles, battles and making the same old jokes over and over again. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying it's not THAT good. Has some good bits, though and Thanos, being a surprisingly complex, grey-ish character, makes one of the best (if not the best) MCU villains ever.",2018-05-25,7,0,0,0,English
657,thor17,"Personally, I believe this movie lived up to the hype surrounding it. I was expecting a lot since there was so much secrecy around it, and now I understand why. The movie did a good job of combining light humor and action, without being over the top or too cheesy. There were a few twists that were unexpected, but I am hoping the second part will clear some of these things up. Combining all the different heroes was a risk, but it seemed to work out (although some parts throughout were a little choppy). In my opinion, there were a few stand out characters that are finally getting the recognition they deserve. I also thought the way they portrayed the villain was great, probably the best Marvel has done so far. They have been leading up to this character for so long, that it would have been a big let-down if the character didn't deliver. Like I mentioned early, I am excited to see how the second movie ties up the loose ends left from the first. To wrap things up, I think this movie was good and definitely one you should watch more than once.",2018-05-27,9,0,0,0,English

664,TJohn,"Wow! That was all I could think of when I walked out of the theater after seeing Avengers: Infinity War. In short, it was spectacular. The visuals were stunning, the score fit the mood just right, and spectacular performances were delivered by Benedict Cumberbatch(Doctor Strange), Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man), and of course Josh Brolin who played Thanos, a menacing, yet oddly complex antagonist.The sheer number of A-list actors and heroes in this movie is indeed a little overwhelming at times, but the Russo brothers did a commendable job at making sure that each hero still felt unique, and part of the team. The acting was definitely one of the strongpoints of the movie, as was the screenwriting which was able to created a genuine relationship between the many members of the Avengers. The storyline of Avengers: Infinity War also delivered much more of a punch than expected. Diverging from the standard Marvel movie storyline worked incredibly well, and I genuinely was not sure what was going to happen until the absolute last shot of the film. The Russo brothers clearly left room for a sequel, but even with the cliffhanger ending, the story seems to wrap itself up rather nicely. When I saw the film on opening night, the theater was packed with well over 100 people in attendance. By the end of the film not a single person said a word, the theater was completely silent. Overall Avengers: Infinity War was a fantastic movie. It delivered dazzling sequences of action, incredible visuals, and enough emotional punch to make me question everything I understood about the Avengers. Is this film free from flaw? Absolutely not, but it is one of the best films of the year by far, and with a budget exceeding a quarter of a billion dollars, it certainly lived up to expectations. 9/10 - TJ",2018-06-14,9,0,0,0,English
665,brokenpolymorph,"A wonderful coming together of previous characters from the MCU. This film would be confusing viewing for anyone unfamiliar with a decent amount of the previous films. Thanos not only looks fantastic, but also is written and performed beautifully. Perfectly balanced humour and drama. Which is saying something considering the amount of characters at play. Unusually, some distractingly bad CGI in some areas, as if they concentrated elsewhere and neglected certain characters (e.g. Carrie Coon's Proxima Midnight). Peter Dinklage also gives one of the worst performances in the whole of the MCU so far",2018-06-17,9,0,0,0,English
666,vanHeff,Great first half of a movie. I assume my ticket is still valid for the second half. The scene where Star Lord is imitating Thor's voice is so cringe and probably the only bad bit in the movie. My favourite bit is Bucky asking Cap if the other guys surrendered.,2018-08-10,9,0,0,0,English
668,AvengersIW,"Best superhero movie ever. No doubt. For those who will say the dark knight, i will say that it pretty close. Infinity War excels in humor, emotion, villains, stakes, visuals, the chemistry between actors, and while you dont get enough screen-time to compare both movie's characters i could say both are on the same level with heath ledger, Tom Holland, josh brolin being the standouts. The dark knight does offer a more thought provoking complex story and does stand alone better than IW. But about Infinity War. Thanos is one of cinema's best villains. He is easily one of the frightening and possibly the strongest villain in all of film. He is after all the first villain to succeed in his plan.He is developed, complex and engaging as a character possibly more than the avengers in this movie. He has strong motivations, is interesting with good reason and backstory to back them up. While the other characters dont get full arcs, many of them get amazing and great moments to shine. Particularly, Thor and Iron Man who i could say get full arcs. They sidelined Cap, Natasha and no hawk-eye but i will hold on the criticisms until i see the 4th one. The actors have amazing, unforgettable and special chemistry between each other. The Heart and soul of Infinity War. The story is simple, but lots of great masterpieces have simple stories like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, etc. But it is engaging and enjoyable than most other marvel movies. The ending is really ballsy. Yes they probably will undo it come the next one, but to leave audiences like that answer-less for a year is a huge risk that payed off. The movie is game changing and mixes the marvel formula with some new ingredients. The CGI is at it's best and with some shots off but it makes sense. The CGI in this movie is like 98% necessary too. Beautiful movie to look at with vibrant colors and good effects. The action is quite simply put exile rating offering some of my favorites in recent years. It is well shot, fun, has stakes and darn well entertaining. The Music is awesome, enough said. The movie is probably the best superhero movie experience that feels like you are flipping through the pages of a comic book. Which i love. The movie is tons of fun the most fun i had in a theater ever. As for flaws there arent any. Some people say this movie does not stand alone. I disagree. Yes the movie is better if you view the others before but they do a good job of catching you up. As long as you dont know some characters you will be fine. The sequel could make this one worse or better, but in this one there is a beginning, middle and end as the movie is told from Thanos' perspective. This story is complete but i assume the next one will deal with the avengers more and make up for lost screen time. Well that was a masterpiece. Also the pacing is easily top 3 most well paced movies maybe first in superhero movies. The movie never stops and is always exiting and fun. It is 2.5 hours long but feels like 1.75 hours. Love this movie. Well scripted and well told. Cant wait to see the next one. I could say more but this review is already long.",2018-06-22,10,0,0,0,English
680,HandolphJoubert,"To fully understand this film, you need to know Marvel to have any clue to know what will be happening in the film. If you know the Marvel franchise, you will find this film extremely entertaining. In my opinion, the new film, Infinity War, was one of the best films Marvel had produced.One of the best characteristics throughout the film, was the humor. If it was not for the characters on-point humor, the film would not have achieved such excellence in critic's ratings. The film in total, is filled with comedy, action packed, drama filled, and for the ladies, has romance.If you are a person that loves plot twists, this film will leave you in absolute awe. The film will have you seated on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, and have you struggling to catch your breath of laughter. I would give the film a rating of 9/10. The reason being the massive plot twist.

687,LiftedStarfish,"I'm not the most qualified person to be writing a review for this, but I do think it was a great movie. I can appreciate the use of color to further separate the different settings of the movie (Green and yellow for Earth, Red and Orange for Titan, and Blue and Black for Thor &amp; his journey with Rocket). Moreover, I also like the way they use Thanos to tell the story, and the amount of time used to flesh him out as a character, and make him relatable, despite being a near-sociopathic antagonist.I will now try to address some of the most common issues that people have with this movie.Many people are irritated with Thanos' fixation on wiping out half the universe, despite how his motivation for doing so makes no sense once he has the Infinity Stones. However, Thanos has been trying to fix a finite resource problem for decades, and now has so much tunnel vision, and has become so fixated on the solution that he already had (kill half of the population), that rather than finding another solution (create more/infinite resources), he simply tried to find the quickest way to his current solution. Thanos is called The Mad Titan for a reason. He was so fixated on his current solution, that he lost is sanity and could not comprehend another solution.The biggest problem many have with the movie is Star-Lord's actions on Titan, arguably directly resulting in Thanos' victory. But, Star-Lord has NEVER been portrayed as being able to control his emotions. In Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, when he hears about Ego killing his mother, Star-Lord does not think, he simply pulls out his gun and unloads the magazine into Ego. Because of this, Star-Lord's actions in Infinity War, while not justified, are not out of character nor are they unreasonable from a story telling perspective.Like I said, not the most qualified person to be writing a movie review, but I need start somewhere. Feel free to dump on me if it makes you feel better because my opinion wasn't close enough to yours, or because I suck as a reviewer.",2018-08-15,8,0,0,0,English
