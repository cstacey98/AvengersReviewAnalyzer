0,Matt Maytum,"The Avengers latest stand feels well worth the wait. It’s not perfect, but it goes to a place most tentpole movies wouldn’t dream of, while retaining the scale, excitement, and humour you’ve come to demand from an MCU movie.",2018-04-24,100,total film,https://www.gamesradar.com/avengers-infinity-war-review-2/
1,Helen O'Hara,"Marvel has solved their third-act problem and villain problem and then some. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. But then, neither are our heroes.",2018-04-24,100,empire,https://www.empireonline.com/movies/avengers-infinity-war/review/
2,Chris Gore,"The perfect mix of thrilling action, compelling storytelling, memorable characters, comedic moments — and all of that works in tandem like an orchestra bellowing an epic score. Infinity War leaves audiences wanting more… and with a lot to think about.",2020-01-15,95,film threat,https://filmthreat.com/reviews/avengers-infinity-war/
3,Michael Burgin,"Avengers: Infinity War is epic in a way that has been often aspired to but never fully grasped when it comes to the translation from comic book panel to the Big Screen. It’s what happens when moviemakers take their source material seriously, eschewing unnecessary melodrama even as they fully embrace the grandeur, the sheer spectacle, of it all.",2018-04-25,93,paste magazine,https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war.html
4,Bryan Bishop,"After years of movies where even the most mediocre heroes appeared to be invulnerable and indomitable, it’s an arresting jolt — and exactly the film the franchise needed.",2018-04-24,91,the verge,https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17276030/avengers-infinity-war-review-marvel-iron-man
5,Tim Grierson,"The film boasts plenty of comic-book action while also making room for a darker tone and emotional resonance rarely matched in previous installments. In a cinematic world stuffed with big-budget movies, Infinity War is a genuine blockbuster.",2018-04-24,90,screen daily,https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/avengers-infinity-war-review/5128524.article
6,Scott Collura,"Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain to set the stakes higher than ever, Avengers: Infinity War successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics.",2018-04-24,90,ign,http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/24/avengers-infinity-war-review
7,Christopher Orr,"Never has the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad. Infinity War—the title is almost too apt—is a narrative juggling act the likes of which I’m not sure I’ve ever seen before. It is far from a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been.",2018-04-26,89,the atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-marvel-review/558983/
8,Richard Whittaker,"The Marvel films have been accused of being repetitive in their structure; Infinity War bursts any conventions wide apart. This is a vast, truly epic endeavor, one that both brings the current MCU to a near-climax (wait for the so-far-untitled follow-up, due May 2019, for the ultimate resolution), and sets the future in motion.",2018-04-25,89,austin chronicle,https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/2018-04-27/avengers-infinity-wars/
9,James Berardinelli,"No, it’s not a game-changer like ""Deadpool"" or ""Logan."" It remains firmly anchored within the “traditional” comic book milieu. But, with an unwavering devotion to spectacle and action, the film throws down a gauntlet where this kind of mass team-up is concerned.",2018-04-25,88,reelviews,http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/avengers-infinity-war
10,Richard Roeper,"Infinity War might be the biggest and most ambitious Marvel movie yet, but it’s certainly not the best. (I’d put it somewhere in the bottom half of the Top 10.) However, there’s plenty of action, humor and heart — and some genuinely effective dramatic moments in which familiar and beloved characters experience real, seemingly irreversible losses.",2018-04-25,88,chicago sun times,https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/avengers-infinity-war-unites-stark-and-star-lord-in-a-massive-marvel-mashup/
11,Brian Truitt,"It could have been an unholy mess, but with directors Anthony and Joe Russo at the helm, Infinity War is instead a glorious, multilayered and clever comic-book adventure with loads of emotional stakes and a perfect foe for Earth’s mightiest heroes.",2018-04-24,88,usa today,https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/04/24/review-avengers-infinity-war-offers-marvelous-take-shakespearean-tragedy/543462002/
12,Rodrigo Perez,"Ultimately, the latest Marvel event is ‘Civil War’ on steroids and as enormous a spectacle as you’ll ever see on the screen that’ll leave you shook. For a movie plot this thin and basic, ‘Infinity War,’ is remarkably gripping, supersized entertainment that should exhilarate audiences, electrify the box office and continue the Marvel hegemony for years to come.",2018-04-24,83,the playlist,https://theplaylist.net/avengers-infinity-war-review-20180424/
13,Todd McCarthy,"With so many ingredients to stir into this overflowing pot, you have to hand it to the two experienced teams of Marvel collaborators who had a feel for how to pull this magnum opus off.",2018-04-24,80,the hollywood reporter,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/avengers-infinity-war-review-1105484

15,Stephen Whitty ,"The script is surprisingly smart, pulling together all the subplots and cutting among all the locations. Chris Pratt’s Star Lord has some clever lines. Thanos is a far more complex villain than we usually get. And the movie ends on a stark and shocking note.",2018-04-24,80,new york daily news,http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/avengers-infinity-war-review-article-1.3951847
16,Peter Bradshaw,"Somehow in its pure uproariousness, it works. It’s just a supremely watchable film, utterly confident in its self-created malleable mythology.

17,Calvin Wilson,"A comic-book flick that’s as thrilling and enthralling as it is pretentious and preposterous. The story is just an excuse for the action sequences, and the Marvel strategy remains intact: When in doubt, blow stuff up.",2018-04-26,75,st louis post dispatch,http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/avengers-infinity-war-is-thrilling-and-preposterous/article_fafed75f-d628-5377-ba08-85785d773e0f.html
18,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,"It’s exhausting, but it’s also frequently effective. It’s surface-level with its emotional beats, but a number of them still land, largely thanks to the continuously all-in performances of the series’ endlessly patient stars. It’s an event that advertises itself as an event in every way, while somehow still managing to justify the immense hype around it.",2018-04-25,75,consequence,https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/04/film-review-avengers-infinity-war-is-an-overwhelming-spectacle-in-every-way/

21,Richard Lawson,"There are moments of high drama in Infinity War—between father and daughter, brother and brother, mentor and protégé, lover and lover—that these actors, as deep in this series as we are, deliver on with teary intensity. And there’s a haunting final sequence that is as grave and, I daresay, almost poetic as anything the film series has done.",2018-04-24,75,vanity fair,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-review-a-fine-salute-to-those-about-to-die

26,Mike Ryan,"So, for basically 90 percent of this movie, I’m sitting there thinking, Okay, this is awesome. Then things changed slightly. And I need to be clear: not to the point it changes how I feel about the movie. I still enjoyed it immensely. But Infinity War did send me out on an unfulfilled note, which, to be fair, is probably by design",2018-04-24,70,uproxx,https://uproxx.com/movies/avengers-infinity-war-review-marvel/

28,Justin Chang,"Whatever else it may be — a culmination, an obligation, a staggering feat of crowd control, a truly epic tease — Avengers: Infinity War is a brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close.",2018-04-24,70,los angeles times,http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-avengers-infinity-war-review-20180424-story.html
29,Alan Scherstuhl,The Russos and the hundreds of craftspeople who worked on this film have dreamed up marvelous battles — especially the one where a motley assortment of heroes take their cracks at the purportedly unstoppable Thanos.

30,Alex Abad-Santos,"Infinity War boasts the most breathtaking, audacious moment in superhero movie history, one that rocketed through my brain and tore apart everything I thought I knew about the past 10 years of Marvel moviemaking.

37,Matt Zoller Seitz,"This movie shouldn't just engage and amuse and occasionally move us; it should shock and scar us.

41,Joshua Rothkopf,"It’s hard to give sibling co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo (makers of the thornier Captain America films) any credit—or blame, really—for steering a product that’s been so corporately fine-tuned. They toggle dutifully between million-dollar quips and Wrestlemania smackdowns, and when they find room for a vista of galactic stillness, it’s not out of any inspired vision so much as the need for air.",2018-04-24,60,time out,https://www.timeout.com/us/film/avengers-infinity-war
42,Matt Singer,"I appreciate the sheer logistical achievement of Infinity War (and the chutzpah of its ending). I laughed a bunch of times, and some of the scenes are definitely exciting.

44,Anthony Lane,"The plot consists of bits: a fiery slugfest, a pause for bonding, a quick weep, and a patch of jokey repartee, before the slugging returns. Acts of sacrifice are dotted throughout, and we are urged to applaud the burgeoning fellowship of those who unite against Thanos, but, in truth, it’s every man for himself.",2018-04-30,50,the new yorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/07/avengers-infinity-war-and-let-the-sunshine-in
45,Joe Morgenstern,"As for everything that happens this time around, it’s a function — or malfunction — of the sequel’s two-part structure.

46,Mick LaSalle,"Over the last few years, the Avengers, together and separately, have spawned a number of good, very good, or reasonably entertaining movies.
