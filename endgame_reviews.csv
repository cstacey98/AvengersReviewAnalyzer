2,Ztheman80,Phenomenal ending to a great 20 year franchise. Thor is still my absolute favorite.,2019-05-17,10,45,40,5,English
3,heysniccker,No spoilers!This movie blew me away!Its like an emotional rollercoaster from beginning to end. It also manages to be one of the funniest and quick witted MCU movies. The audience applauded when the movie ended.It is a must watch!,2019-04-26,10,50,44,6,English
4,Lilydemarch,A good concusion to a mind blowing series of movies. I'm happy with how everything turned out even though I'm dissapointed with the character treatment of Thor and Hulk. An epic conclusion.,2019-05-25,8,48,42,6,English
5,artardmoshea,"The things that I didn't like about Infinity War are alive and well in Endgame.Too much mindless action, not enough good story.Too many characters and none of them had any presence.I spent the whole movie waiting for the Stan Lee cameo and all I got was a Marc Maron flyby.As an old school comic reader, the power levels of most of the heroes in this movie are really annoying.Middle of the pack as far as Marvel movies are concerned.",2019-04-27,7,23,20,3,English
8,Olanamka,"It is one of the best movies I've ever seen! Emotional, unpredictable, amazing... All the theories turned out to be wrong; they made it a complete surprise.",2019-04-28,10,41,35,6,English
9,DeviMon1,"Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.",2019-04-26,10,54,46,8,English
10,bkristman,"A very mixed bag of good ,bad and meh. They actually could have split this episode into 2 parts and it would have been better because they tried to jam way too much exposition,wrapping up of loose ends and results for all characters into 'only' 3 hours.That didn't leave any time for most characters to be anything more than devices to move the plot along.The last hour makes the price of admission worth it though as a lot happens.Anyone worried about Captain Marvel taking over the film as dominant figure rest easy .It's not that way. Still worth an 8.",2019-04-26,8,54,46,8,English
11,Threnodist,"About the all female scene: as a straight guy, I like that scene. I have seen so many negative comments about it and state the scene is so ""forced"". Well, if we use this mindset, the whole movie is ""forced"" because so many things had to happen at the right place and right time: Tony Stark meeting his father, Steve Rogers getting back with his love of life. Also, if Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Star Lord, Black Panther and Dr. Strange are fighting together in one scene, I don't think people would say it's ""forced"" although they are all males. Last but not least, this whole movie is a fan service. Let's just celebrate the diversity of the superhero lineup. Everyone of them is the favorite for some fans. You don't need to bash others to love one. Thank you!",2019-05-02,8,31,26,5,English

14,Jaredc324,"Endgame kicks off with an invigorating prologue (making you believe you are in for the Avengers ride of your life), but then swiftly drags and trudges its way through time-travel confusion. While it's ""greatest hits"" venture lives up to it's sentimental sendoff, it was just eye-winking filler to get to it's grand, over-the-top finale, that offers more than enough eye-candy to be satisfied. But its the final moments that truly give this series it's hoorah that it deserves. And they make you weep, even if you never cared.",2019-05-06,7,19,15,4,English
15,Samir17Sehgal,"In order to fully appreciate this heart warming and tear jerking 3 hour epic, I'd recommend rewatching all the other dozen or so Marvel feature films! Truly mind-blowing special effects and excellent acting, in particular from Robert Downey Jr, RIP, however slightly undermined by forced upon Identity Politics and a be-muddled and confused plot, with the excessive use of time travel not helping to ease more casual viewers into a wider experience. All in all, a good movie and a satisfying ending.",2019-05-04,7,23,18,5,English
16,CerysJarman,"Amazing end to such a long journey. It completely captured how it was Tony's world all along; with a satisfying ending that tied up the loose ends that we original Marvel fans have been wanting to see for a long time. And while there were moments that could be called ""fan service"" it was exactly what we needed after such a long time getting here, It was bittersweet.",2019-04-27,10,41,32,9,English

19,bfoore90,"Endgame was a frustrating film for me to review, Because on one hand I was mindblown by the sheer force of this film. While, it is a satisfying conclusion to the stories of Iron-Man, Captain America and a few others; you can't help but get confused by the convoluted and overthought time-heist middle of the film. It's not as good as Infinity Wars it still provides a ton of emotionally satisfying moments that should please longtime fans of the series.",2019-04-26,8,47,36,11,English
20,ron0001,"I have to say this movie just blew me away, every aspect of it, the character arc that the entire cast go through especially Thor, Tony and Steve the world post snap and of course a 3rd act that just was a comic book come to life in all of it's glory. For me this is a masterpiece and one that I will treasure forever and I'm great-full for everyone in marvel who help made this piece. Best comic book movie of all time in my humble opinion, just a must watch for every fan.",2019-04-29,10,51,39,12,English

24,Jes1310,"Endgame – delivers!  And that is an amazing feat. With more than 50 (!!!) Hollywood stars in one movie and a playing time in the region of 3 hours. This is not your standard superhero flick, no Endgame is more about loss, love, relations, family and just appreciating what you have.I absolutely loved all the funny references to other Marvel movies, and the jokes regarding time travel are hilarious. There are countless references and my favorite is the Coen reference to Thors new appearance.A worthy finale to a journey more than 10 years in the making.Must see if you like Marvel.",2019-05-10,9,46,34,12,English
25,funkytastikk,"slightly disappointing end to the avengers saga. It only kept you on the edge but never got you to jump. personally i felt it lacked action scenes for example, hulk never got to fight thanos and captain marvel came towards the end only. yes i understand there was going to be certain number of dialogue to be made to complete the story but still, as an ending and a 3 hour movie i felt the content should have been more. the movie focused too much on the feels and not so much on the works. in the end its a decent ending but still felt it could have been pushed more.7.5-8/10",2019-04-26,7,23,17,6,English
26,Moish,"It is good closure for this saga of 22 films a great homage to Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. that started this whole thing up, a well managed to a certain point plot about time travel that has its plot holes without which you couldn't justify more than one event in the movie, the most commonly complained aspects I've watched are Professor Hulk, fat Thor and the scene of just superheroines, and they're not bad those have a justification among some other things like several deus ex machinas, the third act is super epic and it's fan service well done not like Batman V Superman where is poorly executed but it is not enough for me to be a better movie in general than Infinity War. More than the plot holes or the ridiculousness of the jokes what I disliked the most was how impertinent they were with the product placement, a commercial for Fortnite, a commercial for Axe and the most brazen of all the Audi one, its clear they gave more priority to other things that make it a coherent film with cinematographic arguments.",2019-05-08,8,42,31,11,English

31,Calmacil,"Epic and emotional conclusion to the Infinity Saga and the first phases of the MCU.Endings are hard and often a letdown. For Marvel to get it so right is an incredible achievment.This movie has so many awesome moments, it would take about three hours to list them all.According to box office, everyone and their mother has already seen it. But if you haven‘t, go see it in the biggest cinema you find.",2019-05-07,10,48,35,13,English
32,The-Lucky-Lucas,"After being the 22nd movie in the franchise, it brings the series to new heights. This movie is best benefited by those who have watched most of, if not all of the Marvel films. Throwbacks and characters appear from more than last decade of movies. The acting and comedy is on point with every joke hitting perfectly and every actor showing their passion for the role. The movies set pieces are perfect with sets from past movies. The action, humor and overall story telling shows the passion that not only the Russo brothers had for this film but everyone involved. The story concludes the 22 films perfectly while also leaving character arcs open for future MCU movies. This movie deserves the praise and excites me for future MCU movies in the future. This movie is a roller coaster which can be benefited most by those who have seen many of the other marvel films. Thank you to all those involved in the production of this movie, you have created a great films!",2019-05-07,10,48,35,13,English

35,AmirhShamloo,The Best super-heroic movie EVER! The MOST Sentimental movie MCU has ever revealed. It's about 3 hours but you just get lost in the movie and suddenly find out the movie has finished.

38,JayMoe,"Summary: Avengers Endgame is like starting to enjoy the best sex of your life, and just when you get to that special moment.....your kids walk into your bedroom. Negatives: There are some girl power scenes that are just too conspicuous. I would have rather had the messages conveyed to me in a more subtle way and not rammed down my throat. Speaking of conspicuous, Bree Larson is out of place in Endgame. Her scenes with the other cast members in some way seem as if they were not a part of the original plan for the movie. The chemistry was just not there. I don't have a problem with Bree or her causes, she can express her opinion on whatever she likes. I just don't think she is ready to take the mantle as Marvels next big attraction. The next problem I had with Endgame is some of the character arcs the directors decided to use for Thor and Hulk. There is definitely some room for improvement. Now for the positives! The movie, for the most part, is a fantastical journey of over 11 years culminated into one giant thank you to the fans of the comic, and moviegoers alike. I loved the action, the heartache, and the triumphal moments that Endgame provided over the 3 hours of film time. You find yourself cheering, crying, and on the edge of your seat at times wanting to see your favorite Avenger give his or her due to Thanos. Thor and Rocket are hilarious! This movie is not a waste of time and you will be thoroughly entertained.",2019-04-26,7,47,34,13,English
39,MarvelJoe,"This movie is more emotional than Infinity War. 22 movies, all characters, character development, humor, intense moment, coming together in one movie.

40,Ken_Heisenberg,"Yes the movie is that good. For any Marvel universe fan this is a must-see movie as it is the last one and arguably the best one. It's a pity that some of the heroes die, which means we definitely won't see them again. The ending is very beatiful.",2019-05-01,8,43,31,12,English
41,noobmaster,"This movie is a solid 10/10 . I know its not perfect but it is a great movie . The action, drama , emotional content and humor is very good . As a long time MCU fan the emotions this movie gave me was heartwarming and heartbreaking . Most hater will nitpick every lil things but in general they re ruining their movie experience and as far as nitpicking goes most of them dont even  make sense it kinda seems like their personal agenda or something to just hate on the movie (DC fan boi alert) . We have been taking the MCU for granted , sure they make tons of money now but rather than hating on everything just be happy to see a movie of this scale . Tbh i appreciate DCEU s efforts but they have spoiled their iconic characters like superman and batman , im still onboard for the next JL film i hope they dont screw it up.",2019-04-29,10,43,31,12,English

43,niolax,"This movie was the best movie that the MCU has made, in fact, i dare to say that it is the best movie ever. It is emotional, epic and it gives you chills because of its greatness. It has incredible action scenes and many easter eggs that marvel fans can find. It is definitely worth watching. The reason it is so incredible is because every movie the MCU made was made thinking in this last movie and you can clearly see it.",2019-04-29,10,50,36,14,English

46,SmashEBrada,"Sure, the first act's pacing is kinda off, and some of the characters are extremely underrepresented (ex.

50,Deependra,"Not being a blind fanboy or been effected by hype, I can say that,The end game definitely lives up the hype but, only for last 30-45mins. The first half of the movie was filled up more with funny humour and unexpected condition of heroes after losing to Thanos in infinity war. Inshort, it falls flat in my opinion.I personally feel that Infinity war was better than end game due to ""powerful"" foundation of story and the fear of Thanos was very well projected.",2019-04-29,8,49,35,14,English
51,The_LizardKing,"This movie wraps up the wonderful Marvel Cinematic Universe amazingly. It is very entertaining, intense, and emotional. The jokes aren't as good as in other movies, like Spiderman or Thor: Ragnarok, but they still exist. The plot wasn't what I expected and there are a lot of plot twists and entertaining characters. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and it is probably my second favorite Marvel Movie behind Thor: Ragnarok.",2019-05-10,10,49,35,14,English

53,HealingToolbox,"Much, much better than it needed to be.  KPCC critics were right, the best scenes are not CGI or action, they are dialogue scenes.  You can't say that for any other Marvel movie I can recall.  I loved the whole Thor goes to pot arc.  It added much dimension to the character.  In the credits the main Avengers actors each sign their name in handwriting.  The whole she-bang, and this movie--definitely worth putting your name to.",2019-05-05,9,52,37,15,English

56,NezharMC,"A movie that seems like 3 movies fused: A part about regret and defeat, a part about a time heist and another that is the great battle we've all been waiting for.The humor is hit or miss, with some jokes being repeated too many times (Fat Thor). The time travel part creates a huge amount of plotholes, but it's interesting indeed.The movie lends too much time for the first part, filling much of the 3 hours of the movie. The main characters on this movie are the original avengers, whose story ends in this movie. The best part about this movie is how it ties up all the storylines of the MCU in a satisfying conclusion.It is a worse movie than Infinity War but it definitely isn't a disappointment. However it gives me the idea that the future of the MCU won't be that great, seeing as the most important Avengers in the next phase are mostly absent (I still don't see Captain Marvel as the leader of the New Avengers, it is still an undeveloped character).Hawkeye/Ronin's storyline is compelling and Scarlett Johansson works the best as Black Widow in this movie, although her sacrifice scene is a bit odd.The final battle against Thanos is compelling although being time travel Thanos makes it less dramatic. The battle between Thanos and Scarlet Witch could have been more emotional with a Thanos that killed Vision.Tony Stark's sacrifice is compelling as the end of Stark's character development, becoming a symbol for the hope of humanity and the Avengers. From being an arrogant and egotistical man to a selfless yet still arrogant hero, fighting for the future.",2019-05-03,8,45,32,13,English

Time travel is a cheap way to beat an enemy, albeit the way they handled time travel is refreshing .

67,youmedead,"I'm not entirely sure how to start this review. I've taken some time after seeing the movie to sit on it and reflect on it to see if my initial opinions on it would change, but I still stand by what I said the instant I walked out of the theater. This is without a doubt the greatest superhero movie of all time, and arguably the best movie of all time in general.   Now, part of that opinion comes from the fact that I have sat by the series since 2012 (yeah, I jumped on a little late, sue me) and have been invested in these characters from the original Avengers. Each little detail that they threw into this movie to callback to other movies struck a chord with me because these movies are such a huge part of my life. Only someone truly invested in the characters of a story can be reduced to sobbing by a conversation about cheeseburgers.   Every scene in this movie was expertly designed to fill you with a sense of elation. You can't help but gape at the beauty of some shots, you can't help but cry in the huge moments of emotion, you can't help but laugh at the little things. This movie was designed in a way that it can only be enjoyed after multiple viewings, because you will miss something the first time, and maybe even the second time, because there is just so much stuff shoved into this movie.   From the opening scene of Hawkeye losing his family to the final goodbye to Cap after he gets his dance with Peggy after years of believing she was lost to him forever, you are filled with a sense of awe and wonder. This movie makes you realize just how much you care about these characters, even if you didn't realize it already.   There are two sequences in particular that made this movie stand out to me. There is the part where they are all in the past, going through their previous mishaps, giving these movies a last hurrah, and it just works so well. It was such a fun, nerdy sequence that you can't help but enjoy it.   The other is (shocker) the final battle. What felt like a ten minute explosion of beauty is actually a forty minute epic. We watch as Thanos makes quick work of all our heroes, leaving only Cap. The shot of Cap standing alone against the army is easily my favorite cinematic shot of all time. But then the portals open, and we finally see the scope of this universe. We finally see just how big the world is, and how many characters we have fallen in love with over time. It is one of the most powerful moments in all of cinema.   The fight that ensues is one of the most chaotic, yet perfect battle I have ever seen. And the way it all ends with the Avengers fighting Thanos for the stones, just as in Infinity War, is amazing. This time, Thanos isn't victorious, but only at the loss of one of the greatest characters of all time.   The way Tony is said goodbye to, first from Rhodey, then Spiderman, then Pepper is incredibly powerful. The funeral that ensues and the dreaded cheeseburger scene left not a single dry eye in the theater.   This is truly a masterpiece that was made by people who truly care about these characters, their craft, and making a good movie. We have so much to thank the Russos for, and we should all go see Endgame again. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it. You won't regret it.",2019-05-03,10,44,31,13,English
68,TheMurman,"Endgame was a great movie and I would see it again in theaters. But, Thanos was underused. In my opinion, Infinity War was better because of how much of Thanos was in the movie. Infinity War was his movie and Endgame was the Avengers movie. Thanos was very much a one-faced character in Endgame. If Infinity War and the first act of this movie didn't exist, people would just see Thanos as a very basic villain.That is the only major problem with this movie. The reason I give this movie a 9 is because of how AMAZING the movie was as a whole. The final battle scene. Holy crap! The final battle scene had my heart beating so fast because of Cap's two words. ""Avengers...assemble."" This was a huge moment for me and every other MCU fan in the world because of how far we have come on this journey. Endgame served its purpose as the end of the ""Infinity Saga"" of the MCU. I'd like to see what we have in store for the unannounced future films. There are many questions I have for the future, but please excuse me as I need to go lock myself in my room and cry a little bit more.",2019-05-01,9,44,31,13,English

73,eastside49er1,"I really enjoyed the movie. Thought it was a great way to end the 22 movies that got us to this point in the MCU. All in all I gave the movie a 9 out of 10. Was not perfect by any means, but if you can put aside suspensions of disbelieve in many of the things that happen, it truly is a superb movie. If you go in to nip pick it to death, then you will probably not enjoy it as much. No doubt there are parts of the movie that drag as well. Lots of twists and turns, especially at the end. No doubt if you are a Marvel movie fan, you have to see this movie. If I had to rate this movie in terms of which was the best Avengers movie, I would put it #3 behind Infinity War and the original Avengers movie, with Age of Ultron bringing up the rear. All 4 movies were superb in their own right. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys superhero/action type movies.",2019-04-30,9,44,31,13,English
74,Efaz,The culmination of the last 11 years of Marvel movies has lead to this epic conclusion of the pinnacle of the infinity saga.

76,arsenalbrendan,"This review will have spoilers, I rate movie an 8 because it lives up to my expectations and I think it is money well spent to see this movie. But I still think that Infinity wars is a better and no Marvel or other superhero movies could reach that level. Infinity wars has an interesting plot to the movie when at the end of the movie characters feel lost and shattered by the love ones who are taken away from them. Endgame teaches you grief and how to move on and in my opinion that theme was used too much in the movie and was very overwhelming, but during this movie you can see the affect on the characters but not the other 50% of the Universe's population who are still alive. How bad is Thanos's snap? Is Earth's 50% population struggling from this incident? How are they holding up throughout this situation? How did the Thanos snap affect other countries politically? this is one of my complaints about the movie even though it's not that major. Another complaint that I have was during the end battle you see every hero come together and take on Thanos and his army, but Hulk was left out of this and we don't see him until Tony's funeral. I would've loved to see Hulk get back into the action even if it's only 5 seconds of him just smashing and throwing the villains like it's nothing. The only scene where Hulk does fight was when they went back in time and Bruce sees his 2012 self fighting the Chitauris during the first Avengers movie. And that's all I have to say about the movie I think that the movie is very decent and I can't wait to see the affects that everyone goes through without Tony Stark in the World.",2019-05-14,8,44,31,13,English

As someone who loves all sorts of movies, I do not make this statement lightly. To keep this as concise and spoiler-free as possible, this movie subverted my expectations in major ways, and I was not disappointed. I was grinning like a fool through the entire three hour runtime. There are some minor hiccups, but honestly, so much is tied up so nicely in this film, and Endgame will be a gold standard that epics measure themselves for years to come.",2019-04-26,8,37,26,11,English

It never ceased to entertain me and it interested me until the end. The only thing that keeps me from saying that this is the greatest movie I have ever seen, or at least of the 21st Century, is that one must watch all of the 20+ movies beforehand in order to fully feel for the characters and be encompassed by the beauty of what the MCU has come to be.

The science behind the story can basically be ignored, but besides that all the jokes are funny as they make fun of different characters in different ways, also no poop jokes or IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT IS LOUD moments. During the final half hour of this 3 hour behemoth of a film my legs were shaking as the recognisable score came on, my heart was way over 90 BPM and my eyes teared up again and again.

89,TheWaffle,"It's very, very good. Endgame cashes in on all of the great moments and characters of the MCU, and makes a film unlike anything since Return of the King. One complaint is that the film starts stronger than it finishes, Captain America and Black Widow shine in the first act as we see their heart-break over Infinity War. It's incredibly moving watching a regular guy in a support group talk about his first date since Infinity War, and then hearing Cap tell him 'we gotta learn to live, otherwise Thanos should've just killed all of us.' The rest of the film is good, but not quite as moving. My only real gripes are the way that Captain Marvel and the end battle are shoe-horned in, the movie would have been just as good without either.",2019-05-02,9,47,33,14,English

What they did with Thor and Banner can be debatable but I found it justified in their own ways. The final battle was something for the eyes. I found interesting that there were still consequences to the choices they made. I give it a 78%.

It takes you on a ride through the past 11 years in the MCU, going back in time, like a trip down memory lane. I loved every minute of it. The final battle is the most memorable in MCU History, topping Infinity War's battles on Titan and Wakanda, and makes the airport battle in Civil War look like a walk in the park. While the ending can be hard to understand (I won't give away what happens) but please note it takes place in an alternate timeline, NOT the main MCU timeline. Just wanted to clear that up, as the Russos said this. It does have some flaws, depending on what you envision for the characters, but overall, I loved every second of it and really truly believe there was no other way to truly tie every loose end and wrap everything up. It's much funnier than I would have thought, but it really works for this movie! RDJ and Chris Evans really leave it all in this movie, it was amazing. Some of their best work. More standouts include Paul Rudd, Scarlett Johansson, and Mark Ruffalo. Marvel really brought their A-Game with this one, and I would not miss this one. If you haven't seen an MCU film, I would recommend, Iron Man 1, Avengers 1, ALL The Captain America movies, Thor: Ragnarok, Ant Man and the Wasp, Black Panther, and obviously Infinity war.",2019-05-03,9,47,33,14,English

I don't not like this film, and I couldn't hate it if I tried too. Its a movie packed with fan service and a decent send-off I suppose.

From when we first see them to now you can see the character growth that has developed in them. This film is three-hours-and-two-minutes long but really you never feel it. You’re so engaged in this movie and the characters that the time just flies by so quickly and every second in this film is important. I feel like if they got rid of anything in this film it would take away from something. That something being the emotion in this film. There is so much emotion in this film that even one scene being removed would’ve ruined it. In the end, Avengers: Endgame is a great wrap up and final goodbye to this part of the MCU.

115,YakusokuNoJi,"This was an absolutely fantastic movie.I am not sure which Avengers movie, 2 or this one, I would choose as the top movie from the Marvel cinematic universe but it definitely is one of the best ones, one of the 2 top ones.First my main gripe, combined with an admirable effort:The writers use Bruce Banner to establish the axiom of how a Consistency Paradox cannot be occuring. And I am glad that they did that. You cannot overwrite something. You cannot destroy the existence of something by overwriting its state and thus also not overwrite the event that served as initiation of the overwrite itself.That was perfect.What was not perfect? Well, first of all, they used Multiverse Theory. That is bad, because it is also inconsistent but whatever - let's accept that, it fits the comics overall and is at least no Consistency Paradox. BUT the story tries to establish ""if we bring the stones back we dry out those time branches"" - what? No. Either they exist or they don't. Trying to ""dry them out"" would mean you would actually depend on the Overwrite Consistency Paradox which the writers so skillfully already cancelled out. Now IF they establish ""the stones were always brought back, we do not overwrite a timeline/delete it, we simply are talking about something that is possibly but never comes into existence"" then okay, then it would mean that within a timeloop they always brought back the stones after getting them. But they very well established that they want to get rid of the timelines so they were no talking about timelines that never existed in the first place. A timeline without a Thanos because Past Thanos travelled to the other branch will always exist. A timeline where Loki stole the Tesseract and fled will always exist and there is nothing they can do about it by bringing back the stones. At best they ""always brought back the stones"" and that's it. The timelines that we know definitely exist even if there might have never been a timeline ""without Infinity Stones"".Now this being said, I am glad that they at least tried and of course its fine that they at least tried to make an effort caring about causality but treating it like there are no other timelines now is just nonsense because from a chronological perspective and the establishment ""we cannot overwrite/delete things"" they very clearly (and realistically) could not do anything about that. The timeloop by the way was also sloppy because Cap cannot bring back the stones in their original state so he definitly ""has not always brought them back to his own timeline"". I do not know if they forgot about that but I can turn a blind eye on that because they really tried other than other movies and Tony's fate was heartbreaking but he got a solid sendoff, so did Captain America. It is great how the movie ended with him giving him ""a second chance"", but I think the writers wanted us to just think about the joyful side of this because the reality is: Even that was another timeline. Captain America had a life with an Alterative Magaret. His own Margaret still became an old, lonely lady in his ""home timeline"" and that is pretty sad and depressing for both.Well, nevertheless for what the movie tried, establishing good character scenes with all kinds of emotions, wrapping up things (even if not completely correct but the effort was here) and offering spectacular finale to this story arc it did a absolutey fantastic job.By the way - there was no solid reason why they could not snap their own set of Stones back into existence. On top of that: i understand why they cannot bring back Gamora and Natasha as they ARE the Soul Stone but Vision existed together with the Mind Stone and Thanos already proved the Stone together with Vision can be brought back so they should have brought him back.I love it times 3000. By the way - half of the time travelling complaints here on this site come from ordinary pop-culture fanboys that have no idea of time phenomena, causality, et cetera. Just as the other half is from Thanos fanboys that really thought Thanos was a hero in Infinity War just because he ""wanted something good for 50%"" completely dismissing the psychopathic part of the character.",2019-05-19,10,46,32,14,English

127,MoviezNP,"After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No. ..Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried its best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least. ..Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical. ..Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is f**ked up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't. ..Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick.

The whole theater was in an uproar about the fan service!The plot is good, The one problem I have with the movie is how they handled the time travel stuff. It does not make a whole lot of sense. but you can forgive that for how awesome this movie is! The Third Act is where it is at! It truly is amazing!It made me Laugh and Cry.

140,Robbe,"Avengers: Endgame is, and I'm not overselling this, a wonderfully crafted film that truly ends one of the best organised franchises ever. Sometimes a bit slow, sometimes a bit tóó much comic relief, and some weird decisions regarding character development, but somehow, it all works, like pieces finally fitting in a magnificent (not at all perfect, but magnificent) puzzle. The two first acts are steady and are greatly dedicated to the core characters, as the third act focuses on the ultimate fight, crafting one of the most epic shots I have ever seen in movie history, and by far my favorite shot from the entire MCU. Regarding the title, Endgame truly feels like an end, and as a rather perfect one for that matter (certainly if you're an MCU fan -- in which case you will experience what is probably the most satisfying ending of a film ever), wrapping up the entire Infinity Saga with some emotional but primarily satisfying and in a way beautiful (dare I say perfect) ending. The screenplay goes through a rough patch due to its complex story, but still manages to deliver a cohesive film. As acting performances are concerned, Downey and Evans again do whatever it takes to pull off the portryal of their legendary characters, but it is Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth who are really performing like their lives depend on it. Ruffalo looks like he had the best time ever shooting this flick, while performances of Johansson and Brolin are steady as ever. As I previously stated, the ending is perfect. There is absolutely no way anyone can guess how the story goes, as Marvel is trying to be as inventive as they can. I am extremely satisfied with Avengers: Endgame, a culmination film that exceeds expectations (that were already pretty high) and that does everything it can to be as spectacular, jaw-dropping and bombastic as possible. Again, satisfying is the word. And epic. And complex. But mostly satisfying and epic.",2019-04-26,10,36,25,11,English
141,Ilovemyson7,"My 7 year old son and I couldnt wait to see this and were not disappointed. From the beginning we get to feel what the characters feel. There is a sense when initially seeing Thanos that he is perhaps somewhat weaker yet this could be the same for the Avengers too. The film unfolds with a downbeat atmosphere then builds and builds. It is filled with emotion, surprises, laughter (Thor especially!) and of course fight. The battle at the end is brilliant and the emergence of the portals letting in Black Panther et al...just wow! All characters have a weakness which is exposed with feeling by the Russo brothers. It makes our heroes gain a sense of the humanistic. They end the saga with integrity and a sense of warmth towards them. The end possibly sets it up for new heroes. If you stay til the end, the metal clanging could be reference to the rebuild of a new iron man? whatever happens next my son and I will be a part of it all.

144,Rebecca31,"A film that really needs no introduction, all us superhero fans have been waiting for this moment for so long and it’s finally here. I still remember seeing the first Iron Man movie in the cinema and I never would have thought it would bring us here. As always this is a spoiler free review but I do recommend avoiding all reviews until you’ve seen Avengers: Endgame for yourself. Honestly you should avoid all reviews and social media in general because not all of us are adhering to the #DontSpoilTheEndgame request by the Russo Brothers. So if you’re the type of person who would intentionally spoil a film like this for someone else you’re the type of person who deserves to be wiped out with a single snap of the fingers.Set immediately after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, the universe is trying to come to terms with the devastating effects after half of the universe have been wiped out. The remaining Avengers are determined to do whatever it takes to try and undo Thano’s actions. I wouldn’t be a huge fan of all the Marvel movies, Age of Ultron and Civil War for me had a lot of problems yet what saved them was the characters and what drives Endgame is the characters we’ve come to know and love over this long journey. I loved Endgame, my heart was racing, I was on the edge of my seat. All the previous films have led up to this moment and no time is wasted diving straight in. With a three hour running time it’s not the type of film you want to buy a giant bucket of coke for unless you’re prepared to leave the cinema to use the bathroom, because don’t let these so called online bathroom guides fool you, there is no part of Endgame worth missing. I can’t speak for everyone but those were the quickest three hours of my life. Despite that I did feel a certain few characters were not given the screen time they maybe deserved, though I understand it would be difficult to give everyone their moment with a cast this big, even with the lengthy running time it just isn’t possible. Though maybe we could have done with a little less of the Hulk eating lunch and a little more Okoye, whatever I’ll get over it.You’ll laugh, you’ll cry and you’ll cheer along with the film. There’s nothing better than being in a packed cinema screen with die-hard fans of the franchise. A spectacular cinematic achievement with a very satisfying ending. A real sense of closure, yes that means no post credits scene so feel free to make a mad dash for the bathroom if you’re not a blubbering mess by the end.It may go without saying but yes you really do have to have seen most of the other Avenger movies, if you haven’t you really won’t get much out of Endgame. Highly recommended but honestly I don’t need to recommend this one do I? You’ve already seen it, it’s made over 1 billion on it’s opening weekend and will continue to break all the records.",2019-04-29,8,49,34,15,English

155,lcamoviereviews,"The time has come. The thrilling conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga and the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. After the shocking cliffhanger in last year’s, “Infinity War”, the long year wait moved fast and slow all at the same time. Now that we are here, the questions began to flow in. Who lives? Who dies? What happens to the world? All of these questions and more are answered but not in the way you might think or in the most understandable way. The film opens up with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) free-floating in space on the Guardians spacecraft with Nebula (Karen Gillian) after the snap from Thanos (Josh Brolin) and losing Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), and Drax (Batista) on Thanos home planet, Titan. Some humor is added to the mix with both Tony and Nebula playing a game of paper football while waiting for life support to fail. This leads to a monologue with Tony recording a message to Pepper (Gywneth Paltrow) through his helmet. After that, it looks like he is close to death. But, a orange glow overtakes the ship and it’s Captain Marvel (Brie Larson)  to the rescue. From there, they are reunited with the team that remains. Fast forward a bit and now they find Thanos, thanks to Nebula. The stones have been destroyed and Thor beheads him. What do our heroes do? Five years later and still no results. The movie petals along for a good solid hour with our heroes trying to find different theories until they realize that time travel is the only option. The first hour of this film does tend to move a bit slower then you traditional Marvel film. We are treated to a very depressing and somber tone with giving each character their moment and what they have been doing over the last five years. The biggest moment by-far is given to Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Beer and time have not been kind to him. Yes that’s what I said, beer. I don’t want to give it away but his appearance generated some of the theater’s funniest laughs. I was glad in this sequence to see a few characters from “Thor: Ragnorak” make a return appearance and see that they are alright. I was really surprised how many laughs were in this film considering where the story is at this time. I think there may have been almost too much funny going on here at times but that may have been just because of the audience that was with me in the theater. Petaling along, we are treated to all of the avengers splitting off into different times to locate all of the stones before Thanos gets them. These were some great sequences and it was great to see some old familiar people from past Marvel films and callbacks to the first avengers film. Time travel is a key part for the whole last two hours of this film and while things to make sense at times, there are also many different plot holes I found too. Some time travel events don’t exactly match up with previous time rules we have seen in other films or what common sense would tell you in these situations. It leads to some convoluted and messy things that still are a bit bothersome especially when five years have passed and at the end of the film, Peter Parker goes back to high school and sees his friend,  Ned (Jacob Batalon). How did high school resume for them when five years have passed? I am hoping this is answered in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Far From Home”. The final battle of this film is quite the epic spectacle. Not as big as some of the reviews were hinting because I still believe in the big picture of things that the battles in the previous film were a bit better. Although the moment where all of the avengers assemble here is quite the goosebumps moment. The CGI is nearly flawless in the film with only some moments in the final battle looking a little too green screen. There are a couple of deaths in the film. One of them I was expecting and another not so much. I won’t tell you here but the one I was expecting gets a proper sendoff and it is a good farewell that feels right. I am also pleased that Captain America gets the ending that I always wanted. It’s exactly what I predicted and if you listen to mine and Jason Kobasic’s podcast on the previous film and our first part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe recap, you will know what I mean. This film bookends just about every thread from the previous 21 Marvel films. It couldn’t have been an easy task for the filmmakers to put that together and create something special. They did and everything comes together real nice in the final moments and I loved the final shot. It  put a smile on my face and felt very satisfied. I still like “Infinity War” a tad bit better then this one but this is still a great addition and an epic conclusion to these first three phases. Bravo Marvel and we will see you in Phase four and beyond. Grade: B+",2019-04-26,8,52,36,16,English

161,kaynisi,"Do yourself two favors before watching Avengers: Endgame.One: watch the other MCU films, or use the (not recommended) Lazy Man's Cheat Code and read the synopsis of each.Two: Do not expect the same level of character development world building from Endgame as past MCU films. (Character development is not the same as character arc completion).I was bothered when I walked out of Endgame last night without the feeling of catharsis that I expected. It did not feel as fresh and invigorating as movies before it—even its predecessor Infinity War breathed more new life into me. I went into expecting a cinematic masterpiece, and that is where I went wrong. Making the ""Greatest Movie of [variable time frame here]"" was never the Russo Brothers' intention. With 22 films preceding this one, there are plenty of moments of cinematic greatness, ESPECIALLY amongst the movies in Phase III. Endgame is not a masterpiece. But it IS a love letter to every fan who was grown with the characters, whether they've been along for the ride since '08 or found themselves binge watching each film in the weeks before its release. Don't expect a movie that ascends to new heights in filmmaking, and DEFINITELY don't watch this movie without being caught up on what happens before it. The Russo Brothers wanted to give fans one last exciting, action packed, heartbreaking, and comforting ""THANK YOU,"" and they achieved just that.",2019-04-27,8,26,18,8,English
162,mrushing02,"This is a tricky one to write when many people have still not seen the film, so no worries if you are reading this, there will be no spoilers. Look for the spoilers on The 602 Club podcast next Tuesday. If you listen to my podcasts or have read this blog, you know I am not afraid to be critical of Marvel movies when I feel it is warranted. Case in point, I felt like Infinity War was, “… a mixed bag that has the effect of one being served a gourmet burger and then only being given a minute to eat it. There is so much happening, yet there’s so little pay off, leaving the audience unfulfilled, wanting a better movie and resolution. We all know the conclusion is coming in 2019, so now that the compulsory is over, we wait and wait and wait.” It was frustrating to feel this way, specifically since I just didn’t feel much about the movie, other than ambivalence and this left me trepidatious for Endgame.So with that preamble, I know you are are all waiting eagerly for my thoughts on the end of the Infinity Stone Saga…. it is satisfying. That’s really what we want after this twenty-one film, eleven year investment, right? We want to be satisfied emotionally and thankfully Endgame is everything Infinity War was not in that department. The movie will capture you from start to finish. Personally I am happy with where my favorite characters are at the end and that is enough.With the three hour run time and the contrivances to overcome Thanos, there are some issues. The movie does feel a bit long, but it also plays out better than Infinity War. Where that movie left you feeling unable to focus because there were so many characters and not a moments rest, Endgame is able to take its time. This may be it’s greatest strength, that you don’t feel rushed, you’re allowed the opportunity to care about what’s happening because you’re not being whiplashed between stories every other minute. For my book, Endgame is the poignantly satisfying conclusion to this part of the Marvel saga I wanted. It is not the perfect movie but it’s the one we deserve. Endgame is rate 4 out of 5 Cap Shields.",2019-04-26,8,55,38,17,English

177,Captain105,"Whoa, just wow, what a movie. In 3 hours of plot, character, incredible action, mind blowing CGI and real emotional scenes, Avengers: Endgame does not cease to stride above the rest of the MCU. A film that brings viewers back in time and allows the viewers to think about how much the MCU has given us. Very contemplative storytelling is blended with great humour and mythic battle sequences to create Endgame! After (I think) Infinity War failed at managing film with lots of characters, Endgame does not.The characters each are represented with a realistic perspective. Their weaknesses are shown to the viewers. And finally the stars are allowed to act. Hollywood’s most famous actors step it up in Endgame and deliver heartfelt emotional scenes and moments without anything tying them down. The best part for me was how Endgame felt like reading a comic book, the action, the plot, the characters. Even some sequences felt like they were drawn by Stan Lee. But as with any film Endgame has problems but minor problems. First, Thanos could have been defeated much quicker. Some characters were glazed over and forgotten about. Finally, the Avengers could have made better choices. There were ways, easy ways, they could have accomplished their tasks. Some of the things they did were stupid. All of these are minor problems. Avengers: Endgame is by far my favourite Avengers film.",2019-05-05,9,45,31,14,English
178,The_Man_XX,"Usually the phrase came full circle is used way to often without meaning but in the sense of Avengers: Endgame Marvel did just that, wrapping up 10 years of storytelling and movies all really well.What I really enjoyed about this movie is that it really took its time with the plot, Sometimes it took too long to get going especially with a 3 hour run time but it was never boring and you just kept getting intrigued with the story elements. When the movie starts it’s right off Infinity War and did really well to establish the consequences of the last movie and to let the characters experience the fallout of Infinity War.As I said the movie really took its time with it plot sometimes it just felt a little too dragged on as it left the directors wanted to over-establish some plot points instead of just keeping it simple but I wouldn’t say it’s a major issue it’s just that in a 3 hour runtime you don’t need to over complicate the plot. However though the story was really fantastic, if I haven’t said it before the Russo Brothers are geniuses they managed to wrap up 10 years worth of storytelling in one movie brilliantly from the First IronMan movie till now.Speaking of characters, obliviously there were a lot characters like Infinity War but Endgame was really about the conclusion of the original six Avengers from IronMan, Black Widow, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Thor. Each one had an arc and came to satisfying conclusions by the end of the movie. The really surprising performance came from Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye or Ronin who we didn’t see on Infinity War and had a really nice story that involved him and his family and the events of Infinity War and how it impacted him. Robert Downey Jr gave the best performance as usual .In all honesty no one gave a bad performance in this movie they all did really well so that’s another plus.Thanos played by Josh Brolin who had a very big role in Infinity War and was a fantastic villain and was one of the best if not the best thing about Infinity War played a small role in Endgame, I mean he was still Thanos he was badass, menacing and obviously had some memorable lines. He wasn’t in the movie all that much except for in the beginning and largely shows up at the end of the movie for the final showdown and that was kinda disappointing, but with the story the Russos went for you could understand why he wasn’t in it that much but still it was kind of disappointing. Thanos was still a great villain in Endgame all that being said and you could fell The after effects he imposed after Infinity War. Without saying too much Thor and Hulk were the twist characters in this movie I mean they did some surprising stuff with them at first I was like Marvel what did you do but in the case of Hulk it turned out all right but Thor...lets just say I didn’t like what they did to him or his arc(if that’s what you wanna call it) was disappointing.The humor was good for the most part of course this is a Marvel movie so forced humor played a factor(sorry if you keep seeing this in all my Marvel review but it is what it is) especially in the case of Thor I mean Endgame didn’t ruin the character of Thor but it’s like they were trying to ruin him if that makes sense. There wasn’t really a lot of action in the first and second half of the movie maybe one action scene in the second act to keep things fast paced, in fact there were like 2 or 3 action scenes in the whole movie(I’ll talk about the final battle just hold on). I mean that was really surprising that a superhero movie managed to keep me intrigued for that much with so little action so again hats off to the Russo’s for a compelling and interesting story. Now let’s talk about the final battle, yes it was Epic I usually don’t describe anything as Epic but the final battle of Endgame was truly a spectacle and I’m glad I got to see it. It was filled with tense moments, awesome comic book action, drama and truly some wonderful surprises, it had it all that I think the final battle was the best action set piece in all of Superhero movie history just truly phenomenal action.The tone of this movie was lighter than I expected after the events of Infinity War I mean it’s not a bad thing, when the movie got dark and serious you felt it. Endgame was part adventure so I guess you’d expect some lighter tones in some aspect. The third act was really the best part of the whole movie and I mean the whole last act, there were some nail biting moments, epic action and wonderful storytelling and heart breaking scenes.So Avengers: Endgame was a really great movie, had awesome characters, an intriguing story, it was fun, had funny humor, fantastic action, really heartbreaking moments and a satisfying conclusion.Sure there were a few things a didn’t like for instance some baffling character decisions or some dragged on scenes but for the most part all I have to say in a nutshell I Thank You Marvel.",2019-05-11,8,45,31,14,English
179,Player2-Water,"E-Value: 9Acting: 9Plot: 9The final chapter of the Infinity Saga story arc which started from 2008’s Iron Man is finally coming to an end with the twenty-second instalment in Marvel Cinematic Universe which the six original members of the Avengers are assembling together for one final mission to save the world.Three weeks after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, the Avengers along with Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, Nebula and Rocket Raccoon have failed to bring back half of the universe’s population because Thanos (Brolin) has destroyed the Infinity Stones to prevent any further use.Five years later, Scott Lang/Ant-Man escapes the Quantum Realm but he is unaware of what has happened while he was stuck in there. After learning everything that has happened in his absence, he meets Steve Rogers/Captain America (Evans) and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in the Avengers Compound. They learn from Scott that time flows differently in Quantum Realm because he only stuck in there for few hours.Believing that the Quantum Realm is the key to restore everything back to normal, they recruit the other members along with Nebula and Rocket Raccoon while Captain Marvel is elsewhere protecting the galaxies. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Downey Jr.) initially refuses to join but he soon changes his mind. Together, they go on a time travelling mission and will do whatever it takes to retrieve the past version of the Infinity Stones without causing time paradox. The fate of the world is now counting on the Avengers.Having watched all the past instalments in this franchise, I got to say that this is definitely the best and most emotional movie in the history of superhero movies. If you think Avengers: Infinity War is the most emotional movie, wait till you watch this one. You will definitely cry and be sure to bring some tissues to wipe your tears. If you have been keeping up with the franchise since day one, you will feel it since by now, you would have invested so much in the characters. Although I never cried, I felt very sad but yet I am very happy to be part of it.The plot of the movie is satisfying, solid, good and a very epic conclusion to the franchise current story arc. Every members of the cast gave their best performance especially Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. It was a truly magnificent performance from everyone since this is the final chapter and some of the cast are leaving after this movie which is quite sad too. The fighting scenes are very well done and the final battle is very epic and awesome just like in The Lord of the Rings series. Despite the movie’s runtime is 3 hours 2 minutes, you will get the feeling that the movie is around 2 hours 30 minutes because the pacing is very good and lots of scenes are not very boring or move too slow.Diehard fans of the franchise must definitely watch this movie. Do whatever it takes to watch it and you cannot afford to miss this one otherwise I can guarantee you will regret it later. Having mentioned the movie runtime earlier, I would advise you not to drink too much water while watching. You do not want to end up going to the bathroom right in the middle of the movie. You simply cannot miss any scenes at all cost.Although the movie is the final chapter of The Infinity Saga, it is not the final movie of Phase 3. That honour goes to the upcoming movie, Spider-Man: Far From Home, which serves as the final movie of the current phase. For the first time since 2008’s The Incredible Hulk, there are no post credits scenes at all. Not even mid credits scenes. Once the credits starts rolling, feel free to leave the cinema and go to the bathroom after sitting for a long hour of watching the movie.",2019-04-30,9,45,31,14,English

They took a pretty surprising turn storywise and it workout really good. I have to be honest and maybe/probably some things are a bit off in this movie. But when you see it for the first time you will be overwhelmed with everything that's going on. A true masterpiece and a great ending for this time.

185,Ibrahima,"Every body of cinematography that is as beloved as EndGame, or Game Of Thrones becomes popular to hate on its last run for some reason, and everybody keeps talking about how “it sucked” because they did not get their personally designed fan service. I loved Avengers EndGame, they did not go for the cliche route of THANOS VS THE AVENGERS immediately, they immediately closed that possibility and left us confused. The time travel part was great because it showed their growth over time, everybody kept talking about how we’ve seen them grow, the time travel highlighted that growth ( Nebula’s old ways, Captain America altough he stayed good,  Loki when he was still a thief and a thief only, and Iron man and his relationship with his father being mended through his love for his daughter and the time travel ), the way they brought Thanos back was a bit forced but it was a necessary for a good comeback. The last fight was simply empic, congratulations to the visual effects team, they are to be credited for that, the fight scenes were amazing, everyone was giving Thanos a taste of his own medicine, I liked the fact that Captain Marvel respectfully let the original Avengers have their moment. They also stayed realistic, Tony Stark died ( as he should have had ) by using the stones at the same time, the death of Black Widow was unexpected since we all knew the actress had her standalone movie ( which will be a prequel for sure now ), and Captain America only has a few years left to live, and depending on what the actor decides Thor got a nice loose ending that could be reincorporated into the Guardians Of The Galaxy’s timeline as the character became comical.I liked keeping the death, well death, I’m really sad that Gamora and Vision will never be again, but it’s life. It has to end at some point. Overall it was a great movie, and a great conclusion to the Marvel Saga, which I suspect will end after this, I don’t think people are ready to invest another 10 years of character buildup that lead to a fateful moment, so like Rober Downey Jr said “it is just a trend”, and I suspect the trend has come to a beautiful and tragic end.",2019-05-01,9,45,31,14,English
186,SimcoeBessel,"Even though you cannot judge the movie without taking into account all the emotions that MCU has put on us, it can be enjoyed the catharsis of the end of an era that the movie transmitted. Personally, I said to myself that after EndGame I was going to cut the fanatism (especially after silly movies like Thor: Ragnarok and Captain Marvel), but I couldn't be more wrong since I find myself waiting for the future of this franchise.

196,MicaelSteel,"It is difficult to not stumble upon a new Marvel movie now and then and, despite some exceptions, such as ""The Incredible Hulk"", they are generally well-ranked movies. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the perfect finale for the MCU world. No matter the few plot holes (which all MCU movies had), the few inconsistencies between characters from comic books and MCU (which always happened as well), it is a movie made for fans that have been following the Infinity Stones storyline, which covered movies from Captain America, Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange and, obviously, Avengers. Without spoiling the movie, I can say that ""Avengers: Endgame"" starts well by setting up the audience with a new reality after the advents from ""Avengers: Infinity War"". This is followed by an intense and well-designed confrontation, where it gets enjoyable to perceive how the different personalities of our heroes engage, namely between the rational down-to-earth nature of Iron Man and the overoptimistic nature of Captain America. This leads us to the resolution of the movie, which sets an intense and emotional climax as never seen in any other MCU movie, leading us to a final breath-taking outcome of the entire MCU plot.For me, and so far, definitely the best MCU movie, and hence the reason for my MCU-contextualized score.",2019-04-30,10,48,33,15,English

The sheer scale of how this movie depicts the finale to the decade-old franchise with its actions sequences and CGI is worth a watch atleast twice on the big screen. It packs itself with humor,emotions, drama and thrill that makes the viewers drool for more even after the credits roll. The characters associated with this one gets their fair share of screen space to complement the cohesivness of the film's plot. The humor unlike typical bathos that plagues most of the MCU movies finds perfect landing at almost every points and those riveting actions scenes coupled with perfectly timed money-shots ramp everything up as true fan service. The Russos clearly deserve a loud applause for having graced the brand with their special touch.This definitely gave that 'The Return of the King' vibe that I had back then and would go down personally as the best MCU movie followed by Winter Soldier, again coming from the Russos.",2019-04-26,9,35,24,11,English
206,WizardOfCoke,"See it, there is nothing I can say that will explain just how incredibly amazing this film is but I shall try, and I know myself now I won’t be able to convey just how brilliant Avengers: End Game truly is and for that reason see it. I’m someone who has never been to see a film twice at a cinema and I’m already trying to find excuses for another viewing, I rarely enjoy watching the same film twice in a year and with this I’m considering twice in the same week it is just that good and I cannot recommend it enough. See it, I do not know how you could not enjoy this film. I also want to mention, I saw nothing of this film, no trailers, no early reviews literally nothing and it made it that much better, now I don’t know if that would affect the experience but there may have been parts I was loving but people already knew of because it was in a trailer. In addition to that, I had not planned to see this movie in the cinema at all, because I hadn’t been as excited for superhero films as of late, silly me to assume a Marvel movie is just a simple superhero movie. But a friend of mine asked when am I going and when I said don’t think I will he responded with so much shock and told me that I have to see it, I booked my tickets there and then, two days before he gets to see it while at the same time being one of the people who saw it opening night. So, you can see my expectations were so low and yet I feel like I can say that was perhaps one of if not the single greatest piece of media that I’ve ever consumed in my life. Being someone who grew up with Marvel movies starting as a child and now being considered a adult to watch this celebration of this cinematic universe truly was magic. It was a love letter to itself in the best possible way, it would have small hints towards previous films that made you proud to be a fan, the last word in the big climactic battle is the best call back I’ve ever heard, and simply writing about it makes me smile and giggle because it’s so clever and brilliant and perfect and I want to see it again and again. Going into this film and seeing that three hour run time pretty much put me off this film I just couldn’t imagine a scenario where a film could keep me enthralled for such an extended period of time, yet it truly used each minute perfectly, nothing felt as if it dragged on or was unnecessary, and that’s itself confuses me how is that possible. Three hours and I’m stick stuck in my seat begging for another ten, twenty, hell I’d take another hour of it was that good. There were two moments that damn near broke me, and while I won’t go into it, when you see these two scenes you just feel this intense sense of dread and sorrow and it blows me away that I’ve connected with so many of these people who are so far from standard people, and it just shows how real this universe feels, you don’t doubt any of it, you just sit there saying “Of course , of course this is happening”. But they have those moments alongside some truly great comedy, and I’m just think how this one film can get so much feeling out of me. There’s a moment in the final smaller scale fight scene where I’m sat there giddy saying it’s going to happen they’re actually going to do it and then you’re filled with so much pride for paying attention to the smallest details in other films that become huge moments in this epic. The music is also phenomenal, it always adds to the tone and it just punctuates what’s going on so incredibly well and it’s another thing that’s leaving me somewhat speechless because how can I convey how amazing this is without someone understanding exactly what I mean. This film is truly the perfect superhero film, the perfect sequel, and without a doubt one of the greatest films of all time. One last time, go and see this film, go and watch this phenomenal piece in cinema before you hear everyone talking about every detail ruining what would be the perfect way to see this film, because when you know nothing about it, everything and I mean everything feels perfect.",2019-04-26,10,35,24,11,English
207,Naedeslus,"So, this movie had tons to live up. The shocking conclusion to Infinity War left it on a major cliffhanger and the Russo Brothers had a difficult task. Give it a satisfying conclusion, while also giving everything closure. Despite a few small issues I had with it, this movie is a must see.It is very somber and a dark story but I was happily surprised to see that it wasn’t totally dark that it had lots of humor thrown in and it never felt forced. The humor was great and while the overall tone is very dark after all, Infinity War ended on a dark note, it really kept things going. The first act was great and really set up the stage.My only two complaints about the film are that it introduces a concept that sounds great on paper but will cause your head to hurt the more you think about it. I though reminded myself it’s a comic book movie and not everything has to make sense. It is a good twist of events regardless. The other part is that the movie is a tad bit too long. It has a great first and final act but the middle act does drag on a little bit. It’s not boring by any stretch but it could’ve been streamlined a bit. The climax though is fantastic. It had the best battle in the entire MCU if you ask me and the ending was genius. So with that being said. I will state that unless you’re a huge fan of the MCU you may not care for it that much but if you’re willing to watch at least the main character films and the Avengers movies, or at bare minimum, the Avengers movies [Civil War as well because it was very important] you probably will be very lost. It throws a lot out there.While I do still have the opinion that the first Avengers is my favorite in the MCU, this is excellent and right behind it. It nails everything from the tone, pacing [despite some small issues I mentioned] and resolution that I fully recommend seeing it. See it in theaters if you’re a fan and as soon as possible and try to avoid spoilers because it’s that damn good and well worth experiencing the shocking twists that do come.",2019-04-27,9,35,24,11,English

210,Clemnts,"I went out of the movie theatre, still astonished by what I just seen through my eyes yesterday. I came without being ready and goddam I was not. The Russos and the whole team offered a beautiful performance from the beginning to the end, the first Marvel giving me out tears (Nat and Tony's deaths were too much). Well, 11 years, what a beautiful legacy, a movie painting a portrait of what has been done before and concluding it on a very classy way. I found back the shivers I had watching the first Avengers in theatre, back on what made the MCU.Incredible, astonishing, the story ends and offer a perfect solution and after reading many and many theories, they succeeded in offering something satisfying.However, the movie isn't, of course, perfect and I found the humour a bit heavy and especially disappointed by the treatment of Thor in this movie (am I the only one believing it wasn't funny and necessary ?). I'm impressed by the way they were able to place Captain Marvel on a very strong position without giving the impression that she took away all the importance around the Original Avengers.The battle scene is incredible, a bit messy but so satisfying and they offer a greater copy than the one in IW in my opinion, where I was lost at some moments and clearly better than Civil War (don't hate me, I was very disappointed by the movie) , the superhero movie with clear problems of camera management (oh god the airport scene) that many people still enjoyed (not wanting to hate on it, it wasn't a bad movie, enjoyable but very poor in its choices).To conclude, I enjoyed Endgame, definitely one of my favourite MCU movie and what an ending! Congratulations Marvel, the Russos, Kevin Feige, all the teams behind the movies, all the cast, RDJ (what would we be without him), Chris Evans (who finally has his dance :)), Chris Hemsworth (wasn't always a pleasure with your movies and I'm disappointed by your treatment in Endgame, bye pal), Jeremy Renner (what a pleasure to see you back on the wheels), Scarlett Johansson (you progressed so much from useless female figure to ahhhhhhhh really heartbreaking character with your death RIP, I'm waiting to your personal movie), Mark Ruffalo (not having the tattoo grrrrr, very happy to seeing him back with Hulk) and the boss, the hero RDJ (what would it be without him, starting from the bottom and now he is here, what an ending for him, my tears went out for it ! Thank you from the bottom of my heart(RIP Stan Lee also, miss you)Doesn't deserve a 10/10 but thank you for the emotions and the 11 years you've given us Marvel, thank you for all what you've offered to me. Never perfect, always criticising the absence of choices and real directives but now I have to admit it, congratulations.

It was a nice conclusion to the series, it checked off all the boxes, all the Marvel franchise characters got their moment, even though some were featured more than others, and it had a bittersweet and poignant ending  Was it great?  No, for me it was just very good.  There weren't any really suspenseful moments where I was thinking, oh my God, how will they get out of this one?!  Everything played out very predictably, and because they had to cram so much into three hours, the story was always rushing to the next thing before you could finish digesting the last thing.  Lots of great humor though, a final cameo by the late great Stan Lee, a beer belly Thor, CGI Michael Douglas from 1970, and some very touching moments, particularly with Stark and Hawkeye in scenes with their loved ones.  Captain America's epilogue was also very sweet.  The big battle near the end was visually spectacular, but as with many big special effects battles, just way too busy to make sense out of most of what's happening. Sensory overload.  And it was over almost as soon as it started.  Still, Endgame is a solid and worthwhile finish to the series, while not entirely amazing as a standalone film.",2019-05-03,8,41,28,13,English
217,MattBrady99,"“I know I said no more surprises, but... I was really hoping to pull off one last one.”After the shocking cliffhanger at the end of ‘Infinity War’, the question that ran through our head’s was “hmm...what just happened?”. Heroes disintegrating out of existence before our very eyes with the last remaining soak up the reality of their failure, and the antagonist finally at peace knowing the monstrous deed is done.‘Avengers: Endgame’ perfectly wraps up 22 movies in a grand and spectacular scale. For a movie that’s three hours long, not once did I feel the length as everything flew by (in my opinion). There's so much going on. The fact this movie even exist and payed off as well as it did, it’s nothing short of a miracle. The Russo Brothers always do a fantastic job directing action and camera work, but little do people mention how they get the best performance out of everyone and really flesh out each character, and I mean every character. I think Black Widow is best handled whenever the Russo’s are involved, in terms of making her dynamic and characterization rather than hard as nails “girl power” trope - that no other director haven’t got the hint yet. I’m also thrilled Hawkeye gets his time to shine, which helps Jeremy Renner work with material to deliver an emotional performance that was pretty hard hitting at times.Same thing with Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-man. It’s incredibly transparent that the Russo Brothers really like this character and doesn't dumb him down to make other characters look good and isn’t just a buffoon. They understand his intelligent and used Scott’s comedic backbone to his advantage. He basically saves the world (besides the rat).Heck, every character gets a great arc, and yes even Thor, which I don’t understand why people argue that he doesn’t. While still having a comedic charm from ‘Thor: Ragnarok’, but when the scene calls for him to be serious, then expect chaos. He really is the strongest and most tragic Avenger. The other main characters also get fantastic and satisfying arcs.Also the acting from everyone was absolutely stellar. Robert Downey Jr. is magnificent as usual, although here it hits home. Chris Evans really grew into the role of Captain America and I can't imagine any other actor playing the part than him. Karen Gillan is often overlooked playing Nebula, as I always thought she nails every role she plays. Despite the heavy make-up, she still can express so much. What's more to say about these actors than best casting ever.The mad titan himself makes a return, but doesn’t have much screen time than “Infinity War” and...well, let’s just say the character goes into an unexpected direction, to say the last. Still a poetic and intimidating villain that can brawl with the avengers with or without the gauntlet. Josh Brolin once again delivers an excellent performance. Thanos is this generation’s Darth Vader.The action sequences are light years more monumental than ‘Infinity War’. If I have to be honest, I shed a tear at the one point towards the final battle. Although the movie isn’t action heavy throughout, but I was never bored during the more slow paced moments.The score from Alan Silvestri﻿ is perhaps the best and most memorable score in the MCU. A mixture of sadness and loss with a booming blast of epic. Perfectly pays tribute to the original six heroes.Now people have complained about the movie having too much fan service, which I personally didn’t mind and couldn’t see the faults, because then again, this entire cinematic universe belongs to them, the fans. The reason why we have 22 movies, 48 hours and 11 minutes worth of movies and this movie pulling in a monster $2 billion worldwide only in 11 days beating ‘Avatar’ that did so in 47 days! While not a stand alone movie, although considering it’s a follow up to the events of “Infinity War”, it would be tricky to do so.For problems: The story had issues throughout and the entire time travel subplot made no sense whatsoever when given a second thought, but then again, how can you make sense of time travel.I didn’t find Captain Marvel solo movie to be all that interesting - both the movie and her as a character, but was hoping the Russo Brothers would resolve that issue and make the character less wooden. Unfortunately even the Russo’s couldn’t save her. Luckily her screen time is incredibly slim, but they literally pulled a Poochie type of excuse when she was absent for a huge amount of the movie’s run time with a “I must go now. My planet needs me”, from ‘The Simpsons’. I must admit, when she did return, I groaned.Overall rating: Despite the problems, ‘Endgame’ still delivers a sweeping epic that leaves the audience feeling whiplash with emotions. Happiness, sadness, joy and excitement. An experience I’ll remember forever.",2019-05-14,8,41,28,13,English

222,JDX_Awesome,"I thought ‘Avengers: Endgame’ was a great movie, but not without its flaws. It’s deeply satisfying and very entertaining in a lot of ways. The themes of depression and loss are handled very well, and they allow the heroes to feel the most human they’ve felt in a long time.As the conclusion to the twenty two movie and eleven year long ‘Infinity Saga’, it’s pretty much perfect. As a stand alone movie (connection to other Marvel movies aside), it’s good, not great. While there are some glaring plot holes that do ruin a few aspects of the movie, I can forgive most of them. The pros out way the cons here, but the cons are definitely there. I had such a good time watching the movie that I didn’t even notice most of the plot holes (not to say there are a lot) on my first or second viewing, they were pointed out to me in other reviews. Here’s the bottom line, it’s very enjoyable to watch, but the second you apply any kind of logic (including rules they established in this movie) to a lot of the plot points, it begins to crumble, but, it gives some characters satisfying endings and others a bright future.I once said that after ‘Spider-Man: Far From Home’, I would stop watching most Marvel movies, but after this, I think I’ll stick around for a little while.Also, f*ck Captain Marvel, she ruined moments that otherwise would’ve been amazing.",2019-05-06,8,41,28,13,English

The amazing character interactions in this movie alone are worth the watch. The story is very simple, but the way they pull off the ""snap reversal"" is beautiful. It ends on a high note, even if it does get a bit confusing with all the time-travel/alternative universe plot holes that arise toward the end of the movie. And I got to see my favorite superhero in the entire MCU do something magical. He started this with ""I am Iron Man"" and he got to end it with that admission to Thanos, who was immediately rendered speechless by it. What a beautiful character arc. It's definitely a 10/10 in my book but for objectivity's sake, I'm going to leave it at 8/10.",2019-05-03,8,41,28,13,English
226,Fanonymous,"I'm a Fanboy, no apologies.After 10 years and 22 movies, MCU brings an end to an era of the Avengers. And it's no surprise that they couldn't please everyone. That's just too tall of a task for any group of artists.But the brilliant team at Marvel and Disney did one heck of a job making a movie that they can be proud of and did in fact accomplish nearly all of their goals.They wrapped up many story and character arcs. They created the options for continuing stories. They finished off the central conflict with a villain that could honestly be called super. And they paid homage to a line of movies and comic books that have given joy to a generations of fans while showing us that the creators of MCU are all fans too.There are of course plot holes and unanswered questions. How could there not be in a story involving hundreds of characters and dozens of interweaving stories? The wonderful thing is that Marvel and Disney had the courage to see it through. Given there was a time that making serious live action movies about comic books was laughed at in Hollywood. That people would never have attempted telling stories that played out over a decade and 22 movies. These film makers not only pulled it off, they proved that it could be done for a much larger audience than any filmmaker had ever dreamed possible.I for one have cherished every minute of every film. Plot holes, problematic characters and all. And I'm glad to have been around to see my comic book heroes recognized by the world.Thanks Marvel, Disney and the myriad of artists who put this all together.",2019-05-13,10,44,30,14,English

No movie -- nay -- collection of movies has more wholly embodied this statement than the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For, as far as filmic endings to 22-movie-long arcs are concerned, this is most definitely as close to the best version of what it needed to be, if not already that. It's as bold, different, monumental, and as epic as it's been sold as, with almost every minute of its beefy runtime ringing true to me as either being completely necessary or entertaining at the very least.

242,JLuis_001,"22 films and 11 years later, Avengers: Endgame is the end of an incredible stage in film within the blockbuster branch.You can hate it but definitely you must recognize that what Marvel Studios built with this franchise is something that will hardly be seen again in this industry.Superhero films existed before Iron Man and the MCU but the ambition of this project completely surpassed everything else.That the audience that perhaps didn’t care about comic books at all was so involved with this saga and followed it until the end says a lot. The tears that the people next to me spilled in the theater only confirmed it.Like Infinity War this film may not be able to sustain itself without the whole concept but as I said at the time about that film I come to repeat here as well. This isn't about that.If after 22 interlaced films you can not understand it, what's the point of saying more about it?Its achievements are numerous. Even with three hours of duration the film never feels heavy, perhaps a little overwhelming for the amount of things happening at the same time but the narrative hardly falls into bumps that make it feel slow or boring.The story is emotional enough especially in the end, even when they reach levels never seen before of fan service, everything feels in its place and I think the most devoted fans will be satisfied.The final battle is spectacular, finally I felt as if I were watching a comic book taking life from the pages to the big screen because the scale and the number of characters make it the most epic battle of the whole saga.But even in spite of its achievements it also has its faults.Despite the lenght you can feel the holes in the story. The visual effects vary too much because in some points it looks pretty good and in others it gets to look very bad. Even the CGI varies in quality because the work is so detailed in Thanos but so simple in Hulk.Even the soundtrack in spite of the quality is not as emotive as that of Infinity War.And for the same reason due to the size of the plot, many characters end up reduced to very small moments in screen.And of the three characters that closed their circle in this film, I must say that the ending of Black Widow was quite bad compared to that of Iron Man and Captain America.Avengers: Endgame closes a cycle and closes it with solidity in a very entertaining show.It's the film that was expected to be and as I said closes a monumental chapter in this franchise in terms of narrative and characters and at the same time laying the foundations for what is to come.Will a new saga of 10 years and more films follow? I don't know, and part of me doubts it, but no matter what happens in the coming years, the achievements of this franchise will undoubtedly be unforgettable for a lot of people.",2019-04-28,8,47,32,15,English
243,Guillermovidal,"This isn't a bad movie, but it wasn't what I expected. There were so many sponsors which were shown in the movie undiscriminately (AXE, audi and Fortnite) except for the PS4 one. There was too much humour and there was a clear social and politic message which looked really obvious in the movie. The strongest avengers such as Hulk and Thor lose the uniqueness of their power in the movie and they are ridiculized while Captain Marvel is stupidly overpowered. The movie has too many stupid jokes and unnecessary scenes. The plot isn't very interesting and it should be more close to the comics. There are still many more mistakes to talk about but it could spoil some scenes. I'm giving it a 7 because of the special effects and the sound/music (even if it is too repetitive during the movie), also because it wasn't as disappointing as Captain Marvel.

I thought what they did with Thor was abysmal, they could of handled that so much better than making him the dude. Professor Hulk was cool, but Hawkeye's Ronan story arc stole the show for the most part. The end war was visually stunning and action packed. the 3 on 1 scene with cap, tony and thor was so awesome. This was a great ending to a decade of movies, everyone was tied in at the end, that kind of story telling and character development is extremely impressive.

257,crumbreon,"I was ready for anything walking into Endgame, and while the towering 3+ hour run time was daunting, and the seemingly insurmountable pressure to outperform Infinity War, I had reservations. The cold-open to the film impressed me. Normally, there is bravado, fireworks, showcasing; this was the Russo's cherry on top of the 11 years of cakes after all. The opening scene set the tone and reminded me of what was lost, and followed up with the plain text title card of the movie. I thought it was immaculate, much like a lot of the ""moments"" in this movie. One thing that cannot be overlooked is that this is very much a finale. It's tying up all the loose ends that need to get sealed off, and it's non-traditional in the sense that it is essentially a victory lap for most of these characters. So in that sense, this movie is not so much a ""movie"", rather than a series of ""moments"", and I'll explain a bit on that. Some of the most impactful scenes resonated with me even several hours after the movie ended. When Cap confidently picked up Mjolnir and joined Thor in beating the crap out of Thanos with his half-broken shield - the audience collectively and audibly gasped. When a broken Thor tearfully stumbled over himself trying to save his mother, and she (accepting her fate) tells him that it's not for her to know. Piper tearfully telling Tony that he gets to rest, after the life from him slips away, following his heroic Thanos-dusting snap from his own gauntlet. The theater was so silent and the emotion was visceral. I could go on and on, but there are simply so many good moments in this film, it's impossible to detail them all without spending 3+ hours talking about them. The ending of the movie was predictable, but very much appropriate. It was safe, and the perfect end for Tony and Cap. Though maybe not as gravitas impactful as some of the other moments in the movie, it did remind me something that the entire series of MCU movies has preached to us: It's the journey that matters, not the destination. Endgame was a symphony of incredible moments, each hero stood out and showed they belonged - and in a cast this large, an incredible feat! I won't be rushing back to the theater to watch this again, not because the movie was bad - but because it was so completely satisfying. Like a traditional home-cooked Thanksgiving dinner, this movie left me without room for dessert, and I think that is perfectly fine. The only criticism the film is guilty of is shoe-horning social narratives in. I would have preferred to see a more organic relationship develop between the female heroes, instead of just throwing in a gratuitous ""she's got help"" and then arbitrarily grouping literally every single female cast member together who have seemingly not even met each other before. It felt extremely cliche, extremely trite and out of place in a movie that went out of it's way to explain a lot of complexities and give solid reasoning behind all of it's other decisions. The only other faux pas I can flag on this film is removing the emotion from the final Thanos fight. Plucking a Thanos who hasn't even found a single Infinity stone from history and making him face our heroes who have literally been morally and physically beaten by him, felt lackluster. Seeing Scarlet Witch just pouring out raw emotion and to have it met with ""I don't even know who you are!"" while comedic, fell flat with me. Thanos only realized that he ""won"", by getting all of the stones and snapping away half of the universe. He had no knowledge of the sacrifice or pain he personally inflicted on every single person in this movie and that was one moment that we will never get to see. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride and I'm happy to see a true end to this fantastic series. It'll be difficult to rise to the heights of this again, and it's likely not something we will see again for another couple decades. So for now, enjoy the journey.",2019-04-27,8,37,25,12,English

259,amheretojudge,"Feige is done with his first arc and so are we, this is more a palette clenser than a tease, bring it more, it is simply ""old style"" good.Avengers: EndgameRusso Brothers docks the universe in one colossal stage where our mighty heroes dances the dance of their life, it is extremely well choreographed. Never has this ever pulled off at such scale, claims Marvel, and Feige proves it, by swooping in every last drop of blood shed in this war. But mind you, it is unlike Infinity War, it never gets too much. There is a certain amount of linearity in their narration that is more focused and polished than the previous installment. It is the ultimate heist, in a sense that it is as big an ambition as the cast is. And so is the storytelling, as rich as the banner goes, the usual baggage of levity that Marvel often failed to own it, comes in natural in here.Split into three acts, this wallop of emotional drama is not the tease for the game but the journey, that Robert Downey Jr. quotes to be proud of. The world of Russo Brothers, is perfectly balanced as Josh Brolin, wanted it to be. What could have been precarious is somehow its best asset, the film is obvious or even obliged to connect the dots. And as much as you feel overridden in this ride, it never grows dull; this overwhelming experience is plastered across the screen for three straight hours that is ought to make the fans giddy up for more.What has been fascinating, is to see, not Thanos turned into a mere pawn of the game, his malleable philosophy is still threatening to the leftover superheroes. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the screenwriters, are free from the stereotypical MCU formulaic structure, it doesn't tap on- a joke, an emotional punch and an actual punch- to the safe beat, they have deconstructed their rhythm for the Endgame, tears are expected, satisfaction; a surprise package.",2019-04-26,8,40,27,13,English
260,JoeDoesntCare,"It was just generally okay. It was going pretty well until about midway into the movie and then all of a sudden a bunch of plot holes start popping up all the way to the end. It's still a pretty decent movie, but I was really disappointed with the ending. They really ruined Thanos who was an amazing character in Infinity War and felt like a completely different character in this movie. I'm sure by now everyone knows they use time travel, and unfortunately as most films that use time travel it just didn't work out well. Without revealing too much, they could of made it work but they started digging  their own holes. Anyways, worth seeing but very meh. Doesn't come close to Infinity War.",2019-04-27,7,40,27,13,English

Tony Stark was great as always, the Hulk became as likeable as ever, Black Widow shocked me, and Captain America did good. I think a real standout is Captain Marvel though. Her power was so brute that it gave me goosebumps but her vulnerability shined through and made me emotionally involved with what she was doing. Thor though...

When the Avengers discover that he has destroyed the Infinity Stones to prevent them from being used again, they eventually decide to do some time travel to get past versions of the stones in an attempt to revive everyone that disappeared.This is a film that rewards you if you've seen several past MCU films, with events of said films going on in the background as the Avengers and their allies search for the stones. The action's great, there are emotional stakes, and the humour generally hits. The directions taken with Banner/Hulk and Thor will probably rub some the wrong way, but this is ultimately a great conclusion to the ""Infinity Saga"".

A few notes though. If you aren't a die hard in the MCU (Having seen every movie) that is fine, but there are a number that are almost necessary to have seen for this one.

Avengers Endgame is one of those movies that you can nitpick the crap out of it but all the nitpicks only cost it a single point, the movie is simply spectacular!

284,NothingReviews,"Don't let that 8 scare you, Avengers: Endgame is by far the most ambitious film of all time and a very important film as no other films cannot create such a big franchise.Endgame is funny, depressing, satisfying and very enjoyable and everyone gave their all (for one) in this film as some actor/actress will probably never return for the MCU after this film. There were a lot of easter eggs from this movie which links to the other films in this universal which was awesome to hear especially at the end. Everyone has a good reason why they make these decisions and doesn't leave the viewer confused. Overall, the action scenes were satisfying and awesome, the ending was a great conclusion to this movie and just in general, this was (almost) the perfect marvel movie and it's definitely worth your 3 hours of lifeThe reason I said almost is because of these reasons:1. Captain Marvel was barely in the movie, they made an entire movie about her and yet you didn't really need to watch it for Endgame as she's rarely in it and she was in the climax of the movie. Plus Brie Larson was horrible in this film and I know that she is a fantastic actress which disappoints me even further2. The movie is funny. Maybe too funny. There are so many emotional scenes in this film but then they quack a few jokes in there which sure they're funny but it destroys the flow of some tear-jerker moments3. Speaking of the flow, when they finish a dark, miserable scene, they immediately go to a bright, happy scene which just confuses me. Why could they just slowly tune down the darker scene and slowly build up into a relatively happy scene?    However, with all the negatives, I will probably rewatch this movie again",2019-04-27,8,43,29,14,English
285,JeromeRiggs,"Avengers: Endgame can be best described by comparing Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame to Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 respectively. The first one is an epic and weird adventure that has both the wacky superhero stuff and great action adventure stuff, and the second is emotional, more character driven and incredibly satisfying but with more wacky superhero and action adventure stuff. With that in mind, Avengers: Endgame ties up the MCU up to this point pretty nicely. It is a love letter to all the other MCU movies, if it was written by a love-letter-writing professional heartthrob.",2019-05-15,9,43,29,14,English

291,ahmedaiman1999,"The Russos couldn't have subverted our expectations in a better way. Simply, because they didn't give a hoot about our expectations. Instead, they gave us a a continuation of Infinity War with a most unexpected conflict. In other words, they went for the head; all we cared about are the stones.They also proved that they understand every character in this universe better than anyone. They delved into their minds and hearts in a way fans ever hoped and fancied. They truly fleshed out our beloved avengers by showing them as more humans exactly as we felt about them at every important moment in every movie in the MCU. They convinced us that these characters really experienced these moments, and thus cared about them as much as we do. The incredible cast, who are at the top of their game, couldn't have complemented what the Russos did for their characters more perfectly.Whilst the unique storytelling of Infinity War never feels ""cinematic"", I absolutely loved it with its epic quality and how I felt that I was flipping pages of a graphic novel instead of watching a movie. The Russos used once again the same exceptional style of narration here, except that, to my surprise, it feels as ""cinematic"" as it gets! I have absolutely no clue how they have managed to do such a thing, but what I know is that this made me realize that Infinity War is flawed, especially in this aspect, way more than I thought. Everything here works twice as good as it did in Infinity War ــــ comedy and drama. Also, this made the fast pacing don't come at the expense of the cohesiveness of the story.The movie did make it a bit easy for itself sometimes (and we can see that in certain decisions that some character took, and a couple of things that are quite perfunctory that they could have gone deeper with), but the movie also took three thousand risks that entangled itself in what could have an endless loop of nonsensical chaos only to serve the franchise's fans, and it did as good as it gets.(9/10)",2019-05-12,9,43,29,14,English

My main problem with the movie was sometimes the humor which for the most part lands but sometimes does not and can be out of place in certain situations. Some nitpicks can be said about some technical or scientifical things but this is a movie with a walking, talking, sentient tree and racoon  so those are minor issues for me.

293,pjonsson,"These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.I have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.It was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.The movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.I was not too thrilled about the “new” Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill’s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character.I was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed.There were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.There were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.Anyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.",2019-05-12,9,43,29,14,English

296,bcuzwhynot,"Avengers: Endgame. Does it live up to the hype? Yes. It takes you through a emotional rollercoaster with references sprinkled throughout, bringing you back to where it all began but has a few moments which make it just short of a 10.Captain Marvel was not needed in the movie and served as a ex machina, ruining one of the most epic scene in movie history where earth teams up to defeat thanos and destroys his spaceship in a scene that looked like a reskin of the last jedi which as we know, was not received so well. There were also some inconsistencies throughout the movie with some power scaling problems. An example is Captain America fighting past thanos and getting flung across but was able to handle his infinity gauntlet punch in infinity war? He was also able to summon mjonir because he was worthy, but if he could, why couldn't others? Thor was also seen fat but still was able to fit in his armor and time suit? I understand the material of the time suit might be flexible but armor doesn't have flexibility so we are supposed to assume he just burned fat in a day? Enough of negatives, let's get to the good parts!Throwbacks really caused me to tear up, especially the time travel back to guardians of the galaxy and original avengers as we've known them throughout all these years and movies. Humour was executed greatly in a movie with such a serious tone but worked. Occasionally throwing in jokes helps viewers recover. It is filled with fan service rewarding old fans but not alienating new fans with a simple plot and was sad to see such characters as Captain America go, seeing how they grew but passing on the torch to newcomers to the marvel franchise and I'm looking forward to see what they do next after thanos. We also continue to see the humanity of thanos and him breaking throughout the course of the MCU. We can see that he wanted to eliminate half the universe and when earth revolts, he offers a different solution but the goal stays the same, to let life live in an utopia and achieve peace which is reasonable, and how much he was willing to sacrifice, almost dying to destroy the stones themselves instead of keeping it with him as they served no purpose, showing his humanity and that he cared for people.Endgame also gave finality to the whole series when people started to say that they were the same movies over and over again and although I don't agree, I can see where they're coming from. Just hearing the theme and seeing the avengers team up for one last time was purely amazing and epic with a good ending. Having no end credit or mid credit scene might seem lazy or usual, I believe that that's intentional as they don't want it to be some opener for a bigger movie but an great end to a even greater series.Marvel, I love you 3000. 9/10",2019-05-01,9,43,29,14,English

302,ethanthewei,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is probably one of Marvel's best movies yet. It starts out with Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Nebula stranded in space. He sends out a distress call, and Captain Marvel (Who, I admit, is too overpowered) saves them both. They soon return to Earth, where the remaining Avengers, are there. They later find out that Thanos is using the infinity stones to destroy the tones themselves. After a little talking, Thor, who is angry since half of the universe is dead because he didn't go for the head, has enough of Thanos' voice and abruptly chops off his head. 5 years later, all the Avengers are split up and depressed. Suddenly, though, Ant Man gets released from the quantum realm by accident. He gets excited and tells the Avengers that they can do time travel since the quantum realm is a dimension that can slow or speed up time. He eventually gets all  the Avengers to get the Avengers to come except one. Thor. They travel to New Asgard and find that his home is invaded by a fat, drunk man, who is Thor himself. They eventually convince him to join them by saying ""there's wine on the ship."" Anyways, they fired up the time portal, and off they went. They all succeeded in getting all the stones back, except for Nebula's team. She get's spotted by the 2012 Thanos, Gamora, and Nebula herself from the past. Thanos finds out his future and launches an attack on the Avengers, who have all 6 infinity stones. Eventually, the Avengers snap before Thanos comes. It takes a while, but eventually, Thanos comes. Gamora has small talk with Nebula from the future, and Nebula tells everthing that has happened between 2012 through present day. She stops the Nebula from 2012, who has a desire to impress Thanos, and shoot her. Thanos brings an army of soldiers and ships, who have many more monsters inside, but then all the Avengers that have been snapped away by Thanos in INFINITY WAR come back from the Quantum Realm. They have an epic fight, and the makeshift infinity Gauntlet falls from the hand of Thanos. it becomes like a football game after Peter Parker picks it up and plays keep away. The movie comes to a climatic end when Tony Stark gets the gauntlet and snaps away thanos and his army, which kills him. Then, after Tony's funeral, Captain America puts the stones away. When comes back, he is very old, since while in the quantum realm, he met the love of his life.Overall, this was a really good movie with a lot of juicy details and battles, using the topic of time travel, and having the same old general humor that the Marvel characters have.",2019-05-11,9,43,29,14,English

306,supermann234,"Avengers Endgame has such a good story and great action and I would say it is one of the best MCU films. It is also at the same time very heart-wrenching as this is the culmination of 21 films in the MCU. Certain scenes will give fans nostalgia as they watch it.

308,MrMovieBuff,"It's only April, but as of now, 'Avengers: Endgame' is my favorite movie of the year so far. It has taken the title of ""best MCU film"" away from 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014). Don't worry about spoilers, here's just a summary of the plot(?) and my thoughts on the film. The film pretty much takes place straight after 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018) where we see our remaining heroes dealing with the loss of half the universe's population after Thanos (Josh Brolin) completely wiped them out with the loaded infinity gauntlet with all six infinity stones. Tony Stark, aka ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) is adrift in space hoping for some good news, while the characters on earth; Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and even Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) of all people are trying to figure out how to take out the mad titan. The movie is very tonally different from 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018), in that, it's more somber, and builds up very slowly. The film, as you know, is 3 hours long, anyone who sat through; 'Schindler's List' (1993), 'Titanic' (1997), or even 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003) will tell you this is no big deal. Luckily, this movie's pace is perfect, you're never bored watching it, especially if you've been emotionally invested in the Marvel Universe in the last decade (I guess this means this movie doesn't stand on its own being its one flaw). Once again, directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, who have been my favorite directors behind this Cinematic Universe, they know how to balance another busy screenplay penned by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The film is wildly tense, funny, gripping, and emotionally powerful. It's worthy every moment you wish to see. I really liked seeing these characters going on this big adventure, and now, it's going to be interesting to see where the MCU goes going forward. The cast, once again, commit 100% to their roles, and this film is going to live on for a lifetime. A worthy way to wrap everything up.",2019-04-26,10,46,31,15,English
309,Geng1s,As a marvel fan I honestly dont think I could have asked for a more fitting conclusion to a decades worth of film.

310,AngryShark92,"This is a classic case of being overwhelmed by hype and desperation for a good piece of writing that our subjective views can outweigh the objective truth of the film. Initially, I wanted to give this film an 8 or 9, but now I am thinking 6 or 7 are more appropriate after multiple viewings.Robert Downey Jr. by himself, is one of the main reasons to watch this movie, he is at the top of his game, his character arc is meaningful and impactful, and all of his interactions in the movie are heartfelt and excellently delivered, especially when it comes to conversations with Captain America, Peter Parker, and his own father.This film also boasts a hefty amount of fan service by bringing all of our favourite heroes together for one last time and it was a treat to watch. All the usual character interactions, funny dialogue, and nicely-timed one liners are present and land properly, with minor exceptions, and this movie certainly does make for a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.Unfortunately, this film also became littered with plot conveniences, inconsistencies, and holes, the moment it decided to introduce time travel. This is always an incredibly tricky plot device that many movies struggle to implement properly, and this film is no exception. Time travel will always open up a million scenarios of ""Why didn't they do this, at this point, to achieve this?"", and it ultimately hurts the storyline as a result.Some characters also seemed to get worse in this instalment. The Hulk, is now a weird human hulk hybrid who is competent with his science (not enough for time travelling), able to control his temper, and is busy dabbing in cafés. Thor is now an overweight, disheveled shell of his previous self, who spends his time drinking and injecting awful Fortnite and online gaming references that won't age well. Thanos is more of angsty teen with emotional issues, rather than the intellectual and maniacal prophet he was in Infinity War, which was one of my favourite MCU characters. Captain Marvel is back and causes more damage in her 15 minutes of screen time than any superhero ever, big sigh on that one.The big battle was a bit too short for my liking, especially considering the buildup and hype it received from its previous instalments, but was still ultimately entertaining and fun to watch. Also have to mention that outside of Tony Stark, Rocket &amp; Nebula were my favourite performers in this film. Rocket, for the comedy, and Nebula for the internal conflict and character arc. I thought most characters were either average, below average, awful, or did not receive enough screen time to evaluate.+ Robert Downey Jr. and his stellar performance+ Rocket &amp; Nebula were great characters+ Excellent special effects+ Emotional character interactions and payoffs+ Some well timed humorous moments+ Worth the theatre ticket price+ Gratuitous fan service- Slow start and awkward pacing- Plot inconsistencies, holes, and conveniences- Over abundance of poorly timed humour moments- Awkward cultural references- Some characters are awful in this- Minor political injections- Captain MarvelOverall, this is a case of the Russo brothers having to do so much within a certain time frame, like closing all the character arcs, and it may have ultimately suffered because of this. Objectively: 5/10, Subjectively: 9/10, Overall: 7/10.",2019-04-26,7,46,31,15,English

Great effort was put into tying up loose ends and finishing the character arcs of some of the more important characters, and though the end product wasn't perfect, it's definitely one of the best superhero movies ever made.

314,Tomtag,"I've just seen Avengers: Endgame (2019) and it was the greatest moment I've ever experienced. If you read this review, first I had to warn you that there would be spoilers. I laughed and cried and sometimes I cheered for unusual and things I wanted to happen. The acting was way better than last time in Avengers: Infinity War (2018). I really am impressed, especially Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans, they're the best! The actions and fight scenes were the most EPIC. The scenes were mostly unforgettable. I could remember a lot after watching it for the first time. Every character were there (except Vision, Black Widow (cuz she's dead) and maybe M'Baku (I haven't seen him). There were portals everywhere and the final battle was a lot better than I had expected. Here are my top 10 best scenes of the movie: 1. ""Portals"" or ""Avengers Assemble""    2. Iron-Man's Death and Funeral 3. Cap Wields Mjolnir    4. Banner mixed brains and brawns together into Professor Hulk 5. Cap shared a dance with Peggy Carter (extremly emotional)    6. Black Widow's sacrifice 7. Thor chops off Thanos' head    8. Thor joins the Guardians of the Galaxy 9. Cap, Iron-Man and Thor vs Thanos    10. Iron-Man and Nebula reunited to the remaining Avengers Some scenes were hilarious like Thor changed into an overweight man and ate junk food, drank beer and played Fortnite with Korg. Some were emotionally sad like when Iron-Man died and his funeral was attended by lots of people, when Cap shared his dance with his wife Peggy Carter that he never had time to do that (the saddest part of that scene was the song, I cried so much) and Black Widow sacrificed for the soul stone. The lines were really iconic to me like ""I am inevitable"" by Thanos and Iron-Man's last words before he snapped his fingers ""And I...am...Iron-Man"" or when Ant-Man called Cap’s buttocks “America’s Ass” (that was funny cuz Cap’s butts are…big”.. It was so strange was that Steve Rogers retired being Captain America but I was glad that The Cap generation passed on to someone else and it was Falcon (Sam Wilson). Also I’m impress what they had done to Hulk, mixing his self and Hulk’s strength (brains and brawns) into Professor Hulk (that’s how they called) but I had a thought that they had ruined Thor (his big belly and “hobo” hair) but it was still fine because no matter how he changed, he was still a hero and he still remained funny. The sountrack was marvelous, better than in Infinity War. Alan Silvestri did an excellent job, especially ""Portals"", I liked that one most. The Marvel Studios intro wasn't how I expected it to be. It was a little unsuitable but I liked the song and when Cap danced ith Peggy, the song “it’s been a long long time” was 100% suitable which made the scene unforgettable and of course, sad also made the ending one of the best superhero movie endings.   The movie's 3 hours and 1 minute was well-used. No scenes were useless or unnecessary at all. The ending was moving but perfect and someday, I wanted to watch this again and again. I just hope it would deserve 2020's Oscars's Best Picture, Best VFX, Best Original Score, Best Costumes and more. Avengers: Endgame is the greatest movie of 2019 and perhaps one of the best of the 2010s and maybe of all time. This is a MUST-SEE. Also, I don’t rate this 9.8 because I’m a big Marvel fan, but I am being fair to the point means the movie deserved a 9.8. I just hope it topped Avatar (2009) at the box office. Now it’s being $1,223,641,414 worldwide. It's one of the movies that gave me more than two emotions and being a blend of humor, action and heart",2019-04-29,10,46,31,15,English

320,Coert,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us a lot of great characters and pulling off a final movie that uses all their unique abilities equally was always going to be a near impossible task. Endgame is proof of that. It didn't feel like the Avengers became a real team or learned much during these 22 movies. Their plans and tactics felt amateurish. I was hoping for something deeper and cleverer, but that never materialized. It was entertaining, well produced and acted, but for me it never got near masterpiece territory.",2019-04-26,7,49,33,16,English
321,Viddiot,"Avengers:End Game provides an entertaining climax to the current generation of Marvel Super hero films however, like Hawkeye and Black Widow at Vormir, it came pretty close to falling from the cliff and failing the mission in a few places, but thankfully crisp (not rushed) pacing provided a life-line whenever we were staring into the abyss.We begin with a continuation of the gloom cast by the end of Infinity War, and are invited to a heartbreaking picnic with Hawkeye, this scene is played well; not overdone. It is sad and reminds us of what has been at stake, and the recent defeat of the Avengers. It sets the tone for the film nicely; we are going to have to confront the emotional debris left in Thanos' wake over the course of the next few hours. We settle in for the ride.The only problem with the picnic scene is it happens during the day, while over in Wakanda...presumably simultaneously, it was also daytime. I suppose we can just re-imagine Hawkeye's farm was in Africa. But it certainly looks more likely a good scene was developed and shot without much thought going on regarding the time-line of events. Which is strange, because as the film goes on. Time becomes a central issue.Stark is rescued,avoiding certain death twice in the space of a few days now...he returns bitter and damaged, as are all our heroes. We go after Thanos then take a break for 5 years.Thor is suffering PTSD. As a big fan of The Big Lewbowski,I enjoyed his transformation here, but had some horrible Luke Skywalker flashbacks, which I think are the main trigger from some of the outrage on-line at this decision. I think it works here, because Marvel has always had a comedic element. Thor had a compelling reason to be in the state he was in, and the writers allow us to see him rise from the ashes of himself again as the final battle looms.Once the time travel story begins, we came close to the fall. The constant referencing of films (as with Spiderman in Infinity war referencing the Alien franchise) and revisiting scenes from previous films seemed to bog the story down. Rather than making me feel connected to these characters because of their familiarity with the actual world, I felt pulled out of the fantasy...the effect was to break the fourth wall and rather than finding it charming I felt it broke immersion. Despite this being essentially a fun entertainment piece I hate it when immersion gets broken and I'm forced to realize I'm in a room full of people I don't know, (despite the enjoyment of the shared experience of watching a film in a theater),I came here to escape all these people for a few hours. Luckily, the time travel sequences are handled briskly, and are used to set up some nice moments with Captain America (which pays off nicely at the end) the Tony, Mr Stark, Jarvis triangle and then Thor with his mother.My only disappointment with the film is the transformation of Thanos (or regression?).He was a mystery for so long, and then his motivation and cold logic were one of the best things about Infinity War. His personal sacrifice and strength of will to persevere toward his goal, were terrifying and unique. Unfortunately, here we take a turn, and his philosophy is reduced to a simple desire to destroy all life, and remake the world(s) in his own image. Oh...this interesting and complex villain is now just a regular Bad Guy. Let's just all beat each other up now.The climactic fight is spectacular, there is a sense of real peril for most of our heroes and the film manages to keep us on edge. There are a few cringe moments, but again it's a subjective and personal question of taste, little things that don't really damage the film but we could have done without.Captain Marvel again giving us an unwelcome Last Jedi Flashback, flying though Thanos's spaceship in a reflection of the Last Jedi Light-speed ram.In the midst of battle, everything pauses conveniently as a few reunions take place, the whole Grrrl squad moment was a cringe, but thankfully they moved on quickly and didn't make too much of a deal about it.Jump to the final moment of the battle and here comes the coup de grace..'I am....Iron man'. Now that moment was excellent, and was worth sacrificing the Thor 'I went for the head' climax by positioning that as a surprise at the start of the film. We got the best of both worlds there.So in conclusion. A worthy part 2 to Infinity War, which was a very hard act to follow, let alone to try and top. The film looks beautiful, the action sequences are easy to follow and mostly avoid 'shaky cam'. A sad but satisfying end for Iron man; his heroes journey is complete. Having grown from self centered to self sacrificing over the course of the films. Captain America says farewell and his decision was logical and consistent to his desires, and Thor seems a great fit for the Guardians of the Galaxy.I look forward to watching Infinity War and End Game back to back in a marathon someday soon.",2019-05-01,8,49,33,16,English

325,IsaacJ,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has certainly revolutionised modern cinema; back in 2008, Iron Man opened to positive reviews but few foresaw the cultural phenomenon this world was to become and the generation of adoring fans it was to muster. Eleven years on and the highly anticipated climax of this particular saga of the MCU hits the screens; Avengers: Endgame. Its predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War may have ended on a rather low note for Earth’s mightiest heroes, as intergalactic despot Thanos succeeded in wiping out half the universe, but they return in full force in this ambitious and decidedly bombastic conclusion.From the beginning, Marvel old hands The Russo Brothers paint a very new world, a greyer one wracked by Thanos’ deadly ‘Snap’. Among the surviving Avengers, there’s a strong sense of survivor’s guilt and very little sense of hope… yet it would be unlike the characters we know to not make one last attempt to save the universe.To divulge in any more detail the plot of Avengers: Endgame would be to severely undermine its impact; this is a cinematic thrill-ride, with surprises aplenty, nodding dollops of fan service and a hefty level of emotional stakes. One thought the sheer scale of Infinity War was seismic, but the Russos outdo themselves with Endgame, crafting a climactic and grandiose, but equally satisfying conclusion to a decade of work. It’s a different beast to its predecessors in many ways, but Endgame still manages to pull off that nifty balance between humour and drama that makes Marvel work.The film can only be described as a victory lap for Marvel, a love letter to their characters and fans. After a brilliantly unexpected prologue, the film takes a little while to find its rhythm, but once it does… it really does. Credit is due particularly to Christopher Markus’ and Stephen McFeely’s script, a quick-witted and compassionate piece of work that propels the story breezily through its three-hour run time. Despite the Avengers’ predicament, it isn’t all doom and gloom; the benefits of a smaller ensemble cast allow Endgame to have that same sense of banter from Joss Whedon’s Avengers Assemble, something that occasionally felt missed within the tidal action of the latter part of Infinity War. Within the first hour, the plot is taken on a definitive path, one that is neither untrodden (there is a memorable comic sequence where the characters wryly commentate on this) nor particularly smooth (plot inaccuracies can easily be raised). Despite this, however, it allows the film to take off on what can only be described as a golden reward for Marvel fans, an action-packed feast of a film that pays due homage to its universe. There’s also a biting edge to Endgame though in its emotional resonance, frequently heart-breaking yet never gratuitous. There are so many aspects that are so caringly rendered in Endgame; Alan Silvestri’s diverse score and the textured visual effects spring eagerly to mind.As always in a Marvel caper, the cast is a blisteringly good ensemble effort. In Endgame, every actor is on top form, bouncing off eachother with natural ease. Josh Brolin’s scene-stealing Thanos from Infinity War is disappointingly less on show here, but this is almost made up for the excellent use of some of the previous film’s more underused players (Chris Evans’ Captain America and Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow are given meatier roles here). A special mention should also go to Robert Downey Jr in a performance that radiates power and poignancy. Avengers: Endgame does sacrifice itself occasionally in the complex myriad of stories it tells; at points, there are a few too many of these vignettes and the film can feel a tad clunky (Infinity War gave the arc to its villain to combat this). However, the paths all lead pretty much perfectly together in a third act that is indisputably awesome and packs an emotive punch.Avengers: Endgame is a monumental piece of cinema, both in scale and significance; these stories have defined childhoods and, here, a fitting end is delivered to this part that not only feels satisfyingly conclusive but is excellently put together by the creative force behind it. Colossal and captivating, this is another sure success from the team at Marvel that looks difficult to beat.",2019-04-29,9,49,33,16,English

Some people don't even understand a concept that they explained VERY CLEARLY in the movie. I guess 10 years old do not have the ability to focus for 3 hours on a movie.It's not a perfect movie, but it's the best finale to a movie saga I have ever saw.

331,KeithDow,"The biggest takeaway from ‘Avengers: End Game’ is just how much of an emotional roller coaster it is.  There are countless opportunities to laugh out loud throughout the three hour movie—our personal favorite was the line “pick a side, Lebowski”—which themselves are perfectly balanced (pun intended) by thrilling action sequences, nostalgic interludes, and genuine moments of sadness.Despite Endgame representing the denouement of the Avengers franchise (and the 22nd film to be released by Marvel Studios for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) the movie itself is also surprisingly self-contained.  The only thing anybody would have to know going into the film is that Thanos snapped his fingers at the end of the last installment and half of all living things vanished into dust.  Speaking of Thanos, his arc is presented most masterfully of all, far more unexpected and complex than anyone could’ve reasonably guessed.  And as of this moment there’s a brilliant Easter Egg on Google celebrating the opening of ‘Avengers: End Game.’  Google “Thanos” then click on the Gauntlet icon containing the infinity stones on the right hand side of the screen.  Enjoy.Rating: 8.5/10",2019-04-26,8,52,35,17,English
333,PauloReviews,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is about memories, nostalgia and tons of fan-service moments. This is a movie that understands its audience and fans, trying to give each character's story closure without forgetting to provide valuable entertainment for the whole crowd. It also might be a tad too cheesy for some people's taste, particularly when there's a comedic relief scene.My biggest concern coming into this movie was the insertion of bland and uninspired jokes that plagued my overall solid experience in ""Infinity War"". This film was an improvement in that regard but it isn't without its cringe-inducing moments. Things like the ""Fortnite"" scene (and more than that I won't say) just made me roll my eyes. It's unbelievable how they manage to overkill it with these comedic scenes that are so painfully unnecessary and do nothing to advance the plot. I understand that you're trying to make your audience have a good time and all, but this is just unbearable.Other than that, the comedy - I thought - worked just nicely for the most part. The jokes that existed didn't ruin the tension.The characters were very central in this movie. Some characters shined; others not so much. I didn't like ""Captain Marvel"" and I certainly don't like the titular character, so I was grateful that she was underused in this movie. Everytime she's on screen and she smiles at the camera, it feels as though the actress is trying to show charisma, but there's none whatsoever. Not that the actress is awful - it's simply that she is not as interesting as the writers are portraying her to be. I know some critics enjoyed Chris Hemsworth's performance and the character, but it's sad to see that the character is reduced to a comedic relief (again).The movie also boasts an impressive budget, with so many set-pieces and computer-generated effects to be observed. This element of the movie provided the writers with so many angles to explore the story. While ""Avengers: Endgame"" is three hours long, the narrative is entertaining enough to overcome the more stale sequences. The movie never feels dull and it keeps you in the edge of your seat. I had a fun time watching it.7/10.",2019-04-26,7,91,61,30,English

336,Dramare,"Overall great movie hampered by a very slow start (3 hours really not necessary here), a lack of consistency (fans of thor wont be too happy), comedy that falls short and what feels forced into the overall quite serious story and some fairly distracting politics pushing. Captain Marvel was an unwanted intruder into the story of familiar characters and quite often I sighed out loud at the blatant attempts to garner the attention of the media or get awards. Entertainment should be entertainment and whether I agree or disagree with the politics, I would rather they refrain from using a fun action superhero movie as a political platform.The ending alone however is a fitting conclusion to the marvel story and unforgettable though to actually enjoy the film properly you will have needed to have kept up with the majority of the MCU which is one hell of a task and will probably leave you a bit tired of the superhero genre. To improve on this movie they would need to have fixed the pacing at the start of the movie, yes its building up to the conclusion but so has every marvel movie, you don't need 2 hours to explain things.They would get rid of the politics pushing. Captain Marvel should not have suddenly popped up to brag about how strong she was, felt empty and insulting to the original heroes. Also forcing all the female characters to be in one scene for a snapshot for the media might sound like a good idea but one doesnt actually fight and one was meant to be fixing something so it felt distractingly pushed.They also should not have messed with Thor as much as they did and they should not have messed around with the 'strength' of all the heroes. This universe is too old to suddenly add a hero a few weeks before the conclusion of it all who dwarfs the rest of them in strength (Captain marvel)...",2019-04-26,7,54,36,18,English
337,saintandrewsfal,"This movie has 4 mentionable issues, two small and two big, but overall it's a fun, entertaining, exciting, surprising at times, and emotional. Small issue #1. The Captain America Vs. Captain America fight could have easily been prevented by future Cap saying something only Cap would know. There's a better way to do that scene. Fight first then future Cap states only something Cap would know, ending the fight. Small issue #2: Pacing of the first act. At 3 hours, the movie mostly moves at a nice pace, but there was a bit of lag at the end of the first act. Big (and biggest) issue #1: Thanos finds out about the plan because past Nebula is on the same ""network"" as future Nebula?!?!? Future Nebula would know that might be a risk and/or would tell that they were reading her memories when she got to the past. That's really lazy writing and it the main plot point of brining Thanos into the fight.  A better way to do that is have either future Nebula infiltrate Thanos and get caught or Thanos intercepts the future Avenergs messages and is concerned enough to investigate and ends up catpuring future Nebula. Big issue #2: The ending with Cap on the bench and Bucky and Falcon watching him. In this scene, if there's one person who's going to approach Cap it's Bucky or both of them, but not Flacon. I mean they even made a whole movie about Bucky, not Falcon. Secondly, if Bucky would have went over there, would Cap have given HIM the shield or told Bucky to send Falcon over? (I'm cool with Falcon being Cap BTW). That's just for starters. The team throughout the movie were trying to prevent messing up the timeline by changing events, but Cap does just that. He goes back and marries Peggy preventing her from marrying her original husband and having her original kids (from Cap: TFA). This is a huge time ripple. In short, because there's so much awesome, funny, and exciting moments, it raises up an structurally 6/10 film to an 8.",2019-04-26,8,51,34,17,English

The plot clearly doesn't want you to think too hard about some of the stuff happening but it does handle the subject matter very well. The length is a bit of a turn off, even though I'd be hard pressed to figure out what they could have cut from this movie. And the ending is very well done and moves the MCU into a new chapter. I'll be very interested in seeing where they go from here, especially since GotG 3, which was billed as the start of the next phase of movies, is going through such turmoil.

To cap it all off, the movie has insane re-watchability, an uncommon trait in most MCU movies, meaning I'll probably be buying this movie on home media as well. While the massive 3 hour runtime could have been cut/streamlined slightly (namely in the first act) and the logic of an important part of the plot is a bit confusing (no spoilers), Endgame absolutely makes up for it by providing one of the most epic, powerful, and fun cinema experiences I've ever had.",2019-04-26,10,50,33,17,English

Not gonna lie, this is probably the most fun I ever had when I first saw Joss Whedon’s take on The Avengers in 2012 and holy schmidt, it’s a gamechanger in the history of comic book movies. Interestingly enough, the film felt like Return of the King in a way that feels badass and emotional and it did not disappoint. Expect for a cultural and historical significance in the history textbooks as the box office numbers does set sail for a staggering $2.5-3B blockbuster margin at the worldwide box office within the first two months ahead. Is Avengers: Endgame worth the hype?

382,Creeper3455,"They said it would never happen. They said it would never be accomplished. But WOW,they’ve done it. I finally had a movie where the Italian Audience reacted to it like an American Audience,and it was glorious. Truly unforgettable. Anywho,the review.Yeah,it’s good. What did you expect? This big culmination of 10 Years worth of 300+ Movies to suck? You must love Jurassic World 2,then.All jokes aside,Avengers Endgame is a beautiful movie that somehow still puts the entire population in the world (Infinity War being just an anticipation of that) as main leads,and still make it a time at the theater full of poetry. Poetry that,for a Marvel movie,is still surrounded by sheer “MCU Formula” stupidity. Not as a whole,though.For a story that lasts 3h2’,this manages to go by pretty fast,like a 50 Minute TV Show Finale,even for one that deals with the casualties that Infinity War had,and just like final franchise movies,they mention almost the entire MCU,right down to the first Iron Man movie being an instrument for the story. The story goes by just like you thought it would go,and much more. Yes,there’s Time Travel (I’m allowed to say it,because other critics mentioned it),yes,there’s the traditional Marvel Formula (even if it lasts for,like,15 minutes in this hulking bowl of Seriousness) and it has a pretty easy structure to follow,which is surprising,considering that 3000 Characters and Time Travel in a Franchise movie are the recipe for a Box Office Flop. Several times they either repeat the same ole’ moment from *Insert MCU Movie name here* or they hint at that. Come to think of it,the structure of the story goes just like how Tony Stark has a great idea and it goes south real fast (remember Age Of Ultron? Good times…).The score by Alan Silvestri is alongside Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther at being the best MCU Score. At parts,it’s reminiscent of Forrest Gump (with the gratuitous melodramatic Violin or a piece mostly composed with Violins like the Theme or “They’re Sending Me To Vietnam”),and like every Final Movie in a Franchise,there are pieces from IW that are repeated in here (“Undying Fidelity”,”Even For You”,there’s a few...).If it has a shot at it (and unless another movie blows me away with that),this better have a Best VFX nom at the Oscars. So many pretty things (and CGI) to talk about in here that I can’t because it’s “Oh So Spoilery!”.But not everything is flawless,as this movie has some flaws that pissed me off A LOT. The First Act of the movie is enjoyable,but there are 2 jokes where they try to modernize it,to the point to where I’ve never thought a Marvel Movie could beat Ferdinand for a Dab joke (and you know I despise those things SO GODDAMN MUCH),and every minute of its runtime is pure Fan Wish Fulfillment,with a big,loud,bombastic 3rd Act that’ll make Nerds real happy. Just let me watch a movie,I don’t need a quote from a comic every 3 Seconds!Thanos got downgraded from the biggest threat of the MCU to “still threatening,but kind of an imbecile”. They try to make him as hateable as someone like Drago Bloodvist (from the How To Train Your Dragon series),but it ends up being a traditional ethic villain that threatens (I MEAN IT) to destroy the entire Galaxy with everything he has (a snap is not enough,huh?),with one decision in general that kinda made me angry,but still hope it’ll improve upon rewatch.Also,if you’re planning on an IMAX watch,see it in 2D,not in 3D. I almost had a headache for 3 hours of 3D Superhero Brawling.  But,aside from the jokes,what is there to really complain about? Just for too much Comedy and brutal decisions,I can see someone hating it a-la Last Jedi. SO MANY RISKS TAKEN IN HERE AND I LOVED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.But still,I had a great time,you’ll have a blast,your family and friends will,and everyone else will enjoy this epic conclusion in a Franchise that,ironically,half the world grew to love as time went by. This ain’t no Spider-Verse,but it’s the best thing the MCU could offer. Besides,I finally got to see an Audience bursting to tears (one girl holding them),so that’s a Big Plus for me. :-D",2019-04-26,8,52,34,18,English

Kevin Feige, The Russos, Marvel Studios and Disney made a movie that really pays off 21 movies and 11 years of building a cinematic universe that started off from one piece of scrap with #IronMan, which I say in a good way since Marvel took a gamble on an unpopular character at the time to make a movie out of, to a well-crafted, well-executed culmination of where we are at now with the 22nd film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in #AvengersEndgame. The movie is packed with great character development, things you hoped to see that you finally get and things that happen in this movie that you don’t expect. And, this movie made me proud that I’m a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Avengers: Endgame is worth 3 hours of your time and should be seen on the big screen in IMAX. Go see it.

Humour is always seen with Hulk and Thor, not to miss Iron man and Spider man here.So it is technically all the heros go to the past, get the stones and changes everything in present but while they have gone to past to get stones, Thanos comes in with them from the past to the present. Even though they change everything Thanos is also back from past to present and the end war happens, so at the end Iron Man kills Thor by snapping his finger using 5 stones and he dies.Black widow gives her life for soul stone, Captain America retires and goes back to his past finds his love.Overall I think Captain Marvel is the strongest hotest and sexiest super hero",2019-04-26,7,40,26,14,English

It is not the best of the MCU film, that goes to Avengers: Infinity War, but is is very close.  Endgame juggles so much story line, with so many characters, that the film almost buckled from time to time.  Story line from the previous film also put the writers in a corner, and resolving it is very much a herculean task. But guess what? They did it, to some extent. Several characters arcs were resolved in a satisfying fashion and some of the acting are great.  Set pieces are obviously jaw dropping and this is where I said...wow...I never expect to see my favorite comic books TRULY come to life.

(The sheer logistics involved making this must've been insane.) And I had the hell of a time with it all!The one big issue about Avengers: Infinity War, the first installment of this film two-parter, is that it had to juggle so many characters, that there wasn't a lot of time for characterization. However, now the cast is narrowed down to mostly the original Avengers. Brought back is the characterization that made so many of the previous films. Here we find the heroes at their lowest and trying to right things. What proceeds is a great character piece We see the conclusion to some of stories of people we've gotten to know after all these years. The finale is the most I've ever been emotionally influenced by a film.Although this is an ensemble piece, Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark/Iron Man is the big lead, the hero that started the whole universe off and all his scenes, his highs and low, are great.Thanos is in less of this, but the cool, collected planner still makes a great villain.Fans of the movie also get to see callbacks to so many plot points and surprise character appearances. (Although, some things might fly over your head if you can't remember or haven't had the time or inclination to watch everything.) In fact, be prepared for many surprises in general.There is some pretty serious subject matter here, especially the first act. However the script manages to nicely balance this with humor. Both Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man have some great delivery and lines.The movie looks great. (Again, the ability to make Thanos' facial expressions look so realistic is amazing.) Although, I wished some scenes were lit a little brighter. You can't always make everything out. The final fight scene is amazing and may be considered one of the all time greats.Admittedly, the movie doesn't have quite the tension of Infinity Wars. The second act is interesting, but not as strong as the beginning or end.Considering the hype of Captain Marvel being in this, she really isn't used much. Karen Gillan does a great job as Nebula and she appears more than in any of her other films, but I kind of still wanted to see more interaction between her the and the other cast mates. A majority of characters from previous films are in this, but if you wanted to find out whatever happened to Lady Sif or Sharon Carter be prepared to be disappointed. I'm really surprised about Sharon, considering that the directors who forged her character did this movie, too.Overall, this movie was an event that will make you feel all the feels, and I recommend you see this before it's spoiled.P.S. Don't worry about sticking through the credits. No end final scene this time. (They really wanted to set this up as a final chapter.) Thought there is a slight something if you're a movie completionist.",2019-04-26,10,42,27,15,English
410,Thwompthing,"Not even close to being on Infinity War's level.  I went to a late show and nearly dozed off a dozen or so times.  I had to struggle to stay awake for the first 2 hours, literally.  It was that boring.  Also a ton of plot holes in this film.  Out of the 50% of everything that Thanos destroyed in the previous film, Ant-man is the only one to return in the beginning, because of some time travel quantum physics thing that is poorly explained, in which Iron Man discovers how to create time travel and isn't explained how, whatsoever.  He just magically creates it in his home with Pepper Pots.  Then there's the fact that Thor is a laughable and pathetic, depressed drunk who makes no contribution at all, and Banner Hulk is just awful.  Go into this film expecting a lot of boring nothingness for the first 90 minutes and you will find it maybe enjoyable.  Now the reason I give it a solid 7 after all this complaining, is that the final act of the movie is very engaging and enjoyable at least.  The action in the Avengers films is always great, and even though this final chapter had very little action until the end, it was good enough to make the film overall GOOD.

425,HTGamer,"Avengers: Endgame is a triumphant and emotional closure of the MCU's Infinity saga, an epic series of 22 movies starting with 2008's Iron Man. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have done a tremendous job in managing so many dozens of characters and making a great movie.Let me start with the bad news. Endgame isn't as impactful as Infinity War, because the 1st movie's Snap that erased countless living beings is about to be undone. Another reason for this is Thanos. In the 1st movie he was a perfectly balanced and well-written villain with a human side. In the latest movie he's been reduced to another blood-thirsty criminal, no different than Ronan the Accuser or Red Skull. I expected to see some more character development and backstory for Thanos, but there was none of that. Still Thanos proves to be more than a match for the heroes in combat, much more so than in Infinity War.Apart from Thanos, everything else in this movie is almost perfect. This is the culmination of 10 years and 21 MCU movies' worth of storytelling. The stakes are so high that nearly every MCU character joins the fight against Thanos' armies. I even expected to see the Kree, the Skrulls, and other cosmic beings such as Dormammu or the Celestials (it has happened in the comics) join the fight against Thanos as well because he's the biggest threat to the Universe, but I guess it would have been too much to ask for. The final battle is as chaotic as those of the Lord of the Rings or other epic blockbuster movies, with a satisfying ending nonetheless.But Endgame is not just fierce battles and non-stop violence. There is plenty of personal drama and tragedies happening, too. Characters confront their past and make amends with it. Others have to grief and keep going. But there is also tons of comedy and fun stuff, as you'd expect from an MCU movie. I could go on and on but I'd spoil things. The myriads of past comic book story references are impressive and touching.Kudos to the many actors involved. Everyone did their best job in this genre-defining movie.But most importantly, the audience in the cinema hall cheered, screamed, ""oooh""-ed and cried multiple times during the film's many important scenes. Particularly during the late Stan Lee's seemingly last ever cameo. That sense of community and ""we are in it together"" kind of feeling is not something usually found in other movies.Avengers: Endgame isn't the end for the MCU though. It's like the season finale of a TV series before the next one is broadcast later on. It's an episode where things calm down after the climax and story threads are wrapped up before the next adventure begins. The MCU will continue, but Marvel have yet to reveal their plans for the future. For now, there is the Spider-Man: Far From Home movie to wait for.",2019-04-26,9,46,29,17,English
426,EpicLadySponge,"It can feel a little odd to watch a movie for three hours without missing out on some critical details that can affect the movie in many different ways, but that would honestly be a lie if I would say that just to bring this film down. Marvel has built its world filled with iconic superheroes that we adore starting with Iron Man back in 2008 and now twenty-one films later, we're now seeing what is literally going to be the most epic final battle in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Avengers: Endgame does not disappoint me when it came to telling its story during the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War and it shouldn't do the same thing to you too. You can easily tell that this is the most carefully detailed Marvel Cinematic Universe movie out of the rest of them and they put their best efforts of care into it resulting in a movie that feels more than just your average superhero movie.

Anyway, you have War Machine still around, but no mastermind to upgrade the tech or repair it when it gets damaged (as it often does).The point is, I don't see a clear path forward here for the MCU and all I can see going forward are a series of individual movies without any further Avengers films.I'm on the edge between 6 and 7 for a rating, because it wasn't horrible, but it was the end of this universe as I see it.",2019-04-26,7,35,22,13,English

432,manningn15,"Avengers: Endgame is my favorite movie of 2019, my favorite Marvel movie, my favorite superhero movie, my favorite action movie, and my favorite movie of all time. Avengers: Endgame was awesomely action packed, beautifully emotionally impactful, and extremely entertaining. The performances that the whole cast gave were exceptional especially from  Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Karen Gillan, Paul Rudd, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Josh Brolin, Brie Larson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper, Don Cheadle, Zoe Saldana, and Danai Gurira. Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Holland, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Lexi Rabe, Pom Klementieff, Tessa Thompson, Jon Favreau, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman, Anthony Mackie, Evangeline Lilly, Benedict Wong, Taika Waititi, and Yvette Nicole Brown all gave stupendous supporting performances. The writing, screenplay, and story were outstanding, funny, emotionally heartwarming and heartbreaking, I laughed a lot and even cried when Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow sacrificed herself, when Peter Parker/Spider-Man was hugging and then saying goodbye to Tony Stark/Iron Man, when Pepper Potts was saying goodbye to Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Tony Stark/Iron Man's funeral. The visuals and visual effects in the movie were remarkable especially Hulk, Thanos, and all of the scenes from the final battle against Thanos and his army. Every single one of the action sequences were magnificent. The outfits and costumes were very impressive especially the new red and white suits that all of the surviving Avengers and the other surviving superheros wore and all of the costumes wore in the the final battle against Thanos scenes. The hair and makeup jobs were phenomenal especially on Karen Gillan as Nebula Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as old Steve Rogers, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Dave Bautista as Drax, and Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. All of the set designs were spectacular. Anthony and Joe Russo's direction that they took Endgame was incredible. The music featured in the film was terrific and the score done for the movie by Alan Silvestri is my favorite film score from a Marvel movie and my favorite film score from any live-action movie or TV show ever. I am confident in saying that Avengers: Endgame will be my favorite movie of all time and my favorite thing that I have ever had the pleasure to watch for the rest of my life. Avengers: Endgame gets a huge A+++ from me.",2019-05-01,10,40,25,15,English

They've done what needed to be done to conclude the saga, abandoning the usual cheesy ways superhero's movies end, and makes you understand that all Marvel movies til now were made in prior to this movie. I still prefer Infinity War over Endgame for being packed with more action (and badass) scenes, as Endgame is slower paced.

The way he begins to look at details such as coexistence after the elimination of half of the planet is very good and how everything changes, as some take it in their own way and others like Thor from another, such as being lazy and Bruce Banner coexisting with Hulk is amazing.Even so, I think they did things that are not right, like discrediting Thanos a bit with his attitude, I think he does not look like Thanos before the snap.And I do not think that what Captain Marvel did is very useful, since it was not very decisive and with the attitude that makes him feel a bit disgusted. Also, captain America take the hammer of thor so without sense I dislike a bit. I think this movie has ended well and has been a turning point in the movies of super heroes and cinema in general.

Hulk was mediocre and Thor was straight trash. Overall, movie was boring and too much over-hyped. Storytelling was nowhere near Infinity War and plot was nothing extraordinary. Thanos became a casual Marvel villain unlike his counterpart in Infinity War. This time he had no depth, minimal emotion and an unimpressive arc. My score is 5/10.

I will rather not get into that to keep this review short. My next issue is with how they mishandled some characters. The most obvious victims to this, but certainly not the only ones, were Hulk, Thanos and Thor. Even humour was not working. You have to make sure to not cross a line when something instead of funny becomes annoying, cringey or even outright disrespectful and offensive. I feel like they failed at finding the right balance in Endgame. The butt of almost all jokes became Thor. Instead of making him funny though, like in Ragnarok we loved, they made us to laugh AT him. They simply turned one of the strongest characters in MCU into a joke and scrapped like 10 years of his character development when he just gave up on his people. That was cheap. Another thing that kept me bothering were the SJW moments. As a woman I love to see strong female characters, but this felt forced. All in all the movie is in my humble opinion a mix of lazy writing, fanservises, and a lot of money that went into its production in hopes that under all that glitter and expensive CGI people will not notice just how weak the plot is.

No answers to what happened to Titan, no answers to the mistery in the wisdom of the stones- First half of movie is very emotional and satisfying- Robert Downey Jr's best acting in his carreer was in this movie- Why did Loki die? What did he mean by ""you'll never be a god"" or ""sun will shine upon us once more""? No answers. And he seems to be permanently dead.- Thor is the most wasted character in the movie. He sacrificed the most, he lost the most, he suffered the most, yet here they make him an alcoholic Zakk Wylde with broken character riddled by insecurities playing Fortnite! He didn't get any redemption nor satisfaction, in the end he gave away what he already had as well, but what of his vision in Age of Ultron? What of his wisdom that pushed him off to go searching for infinity stones?- Movie feels to be changed dramatically after a sudden change of mind and if there is multiple cuts / alternatives for this movie this is not the best one among them, for the depth, immersion, feeling of a structure do not exist in this movie. All the characters and events are miles wide, inch deep.- This Thanos is not the same great antagonist we saw in the IW. He is shallow, insensitive, as a matter of fact, shallower than Ultron.- Action scenes are too chaotic, the fight sequences that focus on characters we saw in IW do not exist in this one.

452,smoothpantagana,"Yeah, I hoped for a good film, but this was nowhere near one…As it stands the first part of this duology is a much stronger film. So Infinity War &gt; Endgame. By a huge margin, I would add…SPOILERS AHEADEndgame was rather disappointing and slow, the pacing was awful, and it just sort of fizzed out by the end of it, not even the death of Iron-Man felt special. His previous fight with Thanos on Titan felt more impactful. And that’s just it… The film rang hollow as a whole. It just did not flow as easily as Infinity War, and was lost in its time travel shenanigans… Spider-Mans and Peppers goodbyes felt like ticks on squares. Its like the rollercoaster ride was a flat line that didn’t take the highs to where they should have soared and as a result it meandered through long stretches of melancholy emotions and dialogues, many of which could have been cut shorter. They lost on film, on action, to honour characters, parents, loss, grief, friendship... I get that, but it’s a lot and too much at times, so they lost the dynamics of film in the process. The films story-telling suffered. Its depressive opening tone was soon undercut by its trademark one-liners and quips, and it soon felt like the whole film was straying in a strange direction where the filmmakers couldn’t decide which way to go and how they wanted to paint the film as it were. The way they went with many of its characters and their moments felt like they were not holding up or were just jarring. Some of these are…What have they done to Thor? It feels like they ran out of creativity so they lazily shat on his character and made him a **** and a loser. Also, Thor somehow beats Thanos with a fully gemmed glove with Stormbreaker, but can’t do so with Mjolnir and Stormbreaker against Thanos without any gems? Where is the consistency? Also, if he takes Mjolnir from another timeline than what does Thor fight with in that timeline, in the Dark World and Ragnarok?What have they done to Hulk?  We don’t get any action from the Big Green. Its especially disappointing after he was held back in Infinity War. So there is no payoff for Hulk? Really? They fumbled his character where he should have unleashed the monster and overcome his fear of Thanos. Big mistake character wise. They left him unused. One-armed and weak. Shame, it still feels like such a huge and glaring missed opportunity.Also, the whole soulstone bit with Widow and Hawkeye just feels like a cheap gimmick after the drama with Thanos and Gamora in the previous film. Hawkeye is mourning the love of his life, his family, so the Russos make him ultimately sacrifice himself for a collegue from office? Cause that’s how their relationship always felt. Isn’t getting the soulstone about the ultimate sacrifice one makes? Why didn’t Banner go with Natasha? It would have made more sense soulstone story wise? Hell, Cap had more chemistry with the Black Widow than Hawkeye… Odd choices.There are many other missteps (a friggin rat?), but in conclusion: Nothing remarkable happens for the first two hours (for an action spectacle film, spectacular action is nowhere to be seen) and the third act or hour feels overstuffed and incomprehensible, with dialogues and action all over the place. Where Infinity War was good at balancing characters, acts and plotlines, Endgame is nowhere near as coherent. The last act feels like too much of everything, and very little of it is quality. Honestly, Endgame does not FEEL like a magical blockbuster experience after you exit the theatre, nor does it deserve a higher grade than a 5/10.",2019-04-26,5,71,22,49,English
453,Rhodawgs,47 out of 100 . Enjoyable somewhat but is clearly set out for closure needing fan base.  Poor script and dull emotional baggage bonded with lucky plot scenes over and over again. Compared to the comic unimaginative and another same old loophole movie dragged out over 3hrs...... entertaining in parts but the 6 rolls in every scene for every instance with these defeated bunch brings eyerolls for the most part. Especially the absolute silly she scenes eyerolls pretty much just barely keeping you awake at this point. Thanos character is inconsistent and stripped down  let alone others in the movie.  Plenty of plot holes and sub plots that are just to rubbish to expand on. The last movie was much better and I'm sure many needed the enjoyment of closure around the story. But a stained finish to the marvel seris really and kinda left out a movie for everyone. The movie was about bringing back and includeing everyone but the movie was catered towards certain audiences and lack luster scenes of luck isn't up to scratch and was a below par mashup . Long .

The last 30 minute is good but then you are left with mainly plotholes in that fight as everyone waits their turn while dispatching easy killable villains and disappearing air support that ignores enemy ships for Captain Marvel.

466,metacec,"Way too many plot holes and inconsistencies to be a great movie. I have always been a Marvel fan , but this is unreasonable. The time conundrum's not withstanding , I feel , the Hulk and Thor were both pushed aside. Capt. Marvel is way too OP and Capt America wielding the Hammer better than Thor? Tony Stark wielding the Gauntlet that the Hulk couldn't take? Convenience is not a good excuse for poor storytelling. Don't even consider the time element. Nothing more than a money grab by Disney and Marvel. Sadly , the fans will flock and they will feel justified. The most important part of any movie is the story. It seems harder and harder to find a cogent and entertaining movie nowadays. Hundreds of millions of dollars and this is the story they come up with? Again , a fan of Marvel since childhood , I feel betrayed. As a child , I mowed lawns so I could buy my favorite Marvel comics. Hated DC and still not really receptive to their stories or characters. I felt the same way with The Last Jedi. So maybe it's a Disney thing. In summation , this movie is truly disappointing for me.

I was looking forward to the movie and got disappointed big time.Endgame is slow. I mean really slow. The first 2,5 h you barley see a action scene. It's full of plot holes, which make the movie unbelieveable. I know its fiction but that doesn't mean you can cut all the logic and get away with it. The plot itself was very predictable but there was not much plot left when you take the jokes and the fanservice away. The antagonist was reduced to the absolute minimum. Infinity War build Thanos as the best and complex villain in the MCU, just to turn him into a one dimensional world destroyer. They alter their characters in parodic ways. Some may find it funny but not me. The humor is also a big factor. Infinity War had funny moments but this was a absolute gatling gun fire of unnecessary jokes and none of them hit. The jokes were overdone and they rode the dead horse many times which lead me to hide my face behind my hands for most of the time.We need better ending to all these years of loyalty.

468,AsukaLS,"I saw the movie yesterday. I'm not a Marvel fan but I saw the Avengers saga and the last movie was good.- Captain Marvel appears at the beginning of the film with some effects taken from a class B movie following a scene with an extremely arrogant dialogue on his part front of the other Avengers. (Come on! you did not appear in the other movies!). Then she disappears during the next 2 hours of film (I guess she went to take a haircut in that time) and she returns to destroy Thanos' ship in a ridiculous way. No one on earth is capable of destroying it? Or do something? Come on!.- The Incredible Hulk takes two whole movies without even giving a slap. It is one of the most important characters in Marvel comics and his scenes seem that they were of a film of Shrek (With a little more of intellect).- Thor... I have no words to describe how they humiliated one of the strongest Avengers. Marvel should never again print a Thor comic after this. I hope to make a team with him in a videogame or see him in a pub sometime. (Or maybe one day I find him playing bowling with Walter).- I did not finish to understand the trips in the time. More precisely in the scene that Antman returns to the present. I do not remember if it was in a previous movie or when he set up that machine. A friend told me what happened in one of the 23 MCU movies. But if to understand 1 movie I must see 23 movies something is wrong. - Excessive humor in the whole movie. It also happened in all the saga. There are moments of tension that need some seriousness in the movies but are ruined by some silly joke.- Unnecessary feminist fight- I did not like the dialogue of the final scene with Thanos saying ""I am inevitable"" and Ironman answering ""I am Iron Man"". I think it would have been better if he said ""We are The Avengers"".Throughout the saga there were moments that seemed to be watching Iron Man movies with sporadic participation of some characters.That final dialogue finished confirming that the saga should be titled as ""Iron Man and The Advengers""- I think the duration was long, maybe 2 and a half hours (or a little less) would have been enough.They missed the opportunity to give a great closing to a saga that began from minor to major.I want to congratulate the sound director and his team.

471,euu,"I wasn't expecting much based on the Trailers and I was still dissappointed. Infinity War was a great movie so it would have been better to just end it there because in order to bring back all their cashcows they came up with the most contrieved time travel plot I have ever seen. These things rarely work in movies and this time is no exception.But even if you turn your brain off at the stupidity of the plot there is very little left to this film. Most of it boils down to ""Member this, guys?"" moments that don't really add anything that we didn't already know to most characters and in some cases ruin them completely(Thor). Also, you can easilly remove about 60 minutes of this movie and it would actually be improved as much of it consists of characters trying to convince other characters to ""just do it"". We know that they eventually will, so why spend that much time on it?How's the action? Boring and devoid of tension. Also, in very small doses. Other the the final battle, that looks like the cutscene of some gereic video game from 10 years ago, there are very few action scenes. How are the visuals? Like most Marvel Movies, cheap and bland.And finally, for the characters, the thing these movies are most praised for? Let's just say that the character who gets the most satisfying arc in the series is freaking Nebula. I guess Cap sendoff is alright, Tony's sacrifice could have been great if there was any buildup to it. the Hulk is still a joke and Thor? Well, after many movies of development where he needs to learn to be a good king he realizes that he just needs to be himself, a fat, drunken slob and leave What's Her Face from Ragnarok to lead Asgard.

480,I_Am_Legacy,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.Great movie, not without its problems, for example Captain Marvel should have been completely wrote out of this movie, she is a character written purely to appease the SJW types who dont even watch these movies, I dread to think what would have happened if she was in it anymore, her whole character takes away the merits the other characters have earned. If they wanted badass woman in this movie then they already have them.Secondly, time travel. While it was fun watching the various characters visit their pasts and revisiting past movies from different perspectives time travel is something that has been done 1000's of times and is not really an original concept, the vast amount of plot holes it leaves are just not worth it. Finally some characters are sidelined for the movies who really shouldn't be I'll let you decide for yourself who you think deserved more time.Overall this is a good movie, if it were up to me I would have done it differently really its only introducing an overpowered character ( Captain Marvel ) and time travel that really let it down, it basically nullifies the past losses and achievements of the movies and its characters as anything they have done can be so easily rectified.I give this movie a 7/10 I am not being too harsh I think this is just right for the movie, I will be 100% watching it again when it comes out of blu-ray.",2019-05-08,7,12,12,0,English

483,theredsky,"This is an amazing film. I love almost every aspect of this film. As a Marvel fan, I can definitely say that Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to the fans and provides a satisfying emotional conclusion. Before I get started, here is a spoiler warning. Go see Avengers: Endgame and then come back. Let’s get some negatives out of the way. Everything up until the Time Heist drags on and starts to get boring. I know that they need to set everything up for the 2nd and 3rd acts of the film but I wish they had done it better. The 2nd and 3rd acts of this film make up for this though. I also didn’t like the explanation for the their time travel. The film basically states that anything the characters do in the past doesn’t affect the future which makes no sense at all. I know that this is their own rule but it just makes no sense at all. Why would changing the past not affect the future at all. That would mean that Nebula would have disappeared when she killed her past self. The one other problem is that some of the jokes didn’t work. The positives far outweigh the negatives though. The cast does an outstanding job especially all of the main Avengers. I loved watching them together with War Machine, Nebula, and Rocket. All the supporting characters also did an amazing job. The plot can get confusing sometimes but generally, it’s understandable. The tone remains consistent throughout the film. It’s sometimes funny when it needs to be funny and it’s serious when it needs to be serious. The cinematography was fine. It wasn’t anything special. The visual effects for this film are amazing though. The armies look mostly real and Thanos looks great as always. There is a lot of emotional weight to this film which kinda surprised me. I was expecting Hawkeye to die but I was generally surprised and sad when they killed off Black Widow. I was really sad when they killed Iron Man. I knew they were but I didn’t know how they would kill him. It was incredibly satisfying to hear Iron Man say “I am Iron Man” one last time. His death is sad but satisfying. The funeral scene at the end of the film was so awesome and brought back some characters we haven’t seen for a long time. The action in this film is probably the best in the MCU. The climactic battle at the end is in my opinion the best action scene in all of cinema. Captain America wielding Mjolnir was so awesome to watch. Personally, I loved the ending for Captain America. He got to live the life he never lived. Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a satisfying conclusion to the first 22 films in the MCU while boosting a very strong cast, some amazing action, and an immensely satisfying conclusion. I give Avengers: Endgame a 9.5/10.",2019-06-17,8,12,12,0,English

563,Tss5078,"Avengers: Endgame is now officially the highest grossing movie of all-time, but does it live up to they hype? The film does have everything you'd expect from a Marvel film, including a great cast, amazing special effects, shocking moments, incredible action, and of course humor. To the lay person, I supposed it could be considered a perfect film, but to me, a person who has dedicated themselves to Science Fiction, I saw some pretty big plots holes, (I won't discuss them here as I don't give spoilers in my reviews, but we can talk about them at length in the comments section). In order to counteract the actions of Thanos (Josh Brolin) in the previous film, the remaining Avengers need to try all kinds of things, and they try a literal smorgasbord of Science Fiction classics from time travel to alternate universes. While these make for great story telling, there is a format to them and universal rules but this film ignores all of those. I wouldn't say that takes much away from a truly fantastic story, but it's something that bothered me. What I have always loved about the Avengers is the ability to take all these huge stars and larger than live characters and put them into one film, without overdoing it. Everyone has their place and it's always a perfect fit. No one is the star of the film, but no one is ignored either, it's just something that is so rarely done and almost never works out quite this well. As for the nearly three hour running time, the film is so well paced that you don't even notice it. The Bottom Line is that a lot of series try to overdo it for the big finally and end up falling flat (shout out to Game of Thrones). This is not the case with the Avengers as they really did save the best for last.",2019-06-07,9,12,11,1,English

565,Karmazyn83,"Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman,  fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade.The movie itself  was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from  all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with  achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie.",2019-05-07,7,12,11,1,English

576,Megastargaming,"Avengers: Endgame is an amazing cinematic experience. It had just enough action, it was emotional, and hilarious. My favorite action scene was the final battle. The moment the portals showed up and all the dusted Avengers came out of the portals I was hyperventilating. My favorite emotional scene would have to be Tony sacrificing himself to save millions. Thanos did not last long whatsoever in the hands of Iron Man. Finally, my favorite hilarious scene would have to be Thor taking the headset and threatening to fly to Noobslayer's house, take his arms off, and shove them up his ass. Every theory I came up with was true. I theorized that the Quantum Realm would have a role in the plot, I theorized that the dusted Avengers would come back, and I theorized that we would get Professor Hulk.    There were a few things that I didn't like much about the movie. In the beginning when Tony was sleeping on the Benatar then Captain Marvel shows up, the movie doesn't explain how she found him and Bruce Banner did not have many action scenes at all. The only action scene that I can remember was Bruce lazily acting like Hulk. Besides all my dislikes I really liked this movie.

577,James435,"I cannot genuinely give Endgame anything less than a 7/10 rating. The film was good, but it most certainly wasn't better than Infinity War. It's pretty much the Return of the Jedi of the saga. The final battle was entertaining, seeing all the characters brought back was the best, and watching Thanos turn to dust was cool. However, a lot of people are disappointed with what they did to Thor's character; they mindlessly nerfed him. Overweight Thor in the beginning was ok. He wanted to live a normal life, and he felt guilty for failing to defeat Thanos.However, they kept him that way all throughout the entire movie. It was disgraceful. His character digressed with very little payoffs, if any. It wouldn't take long for the God of Thunder to get in shape. He's not an average joe. It's like they purposely kept him that way because they wanted to show the full power and capabilities of Captain America. Thor wanting his revenge on Thanos after failing in Infinity War would have worked, too.As for Captain Marvel, she was barely even in the movie, which is a good thing because fans despise the actress, and yet, she made one of the greatest undeserved impacts on helping to defeat Thanos, while destroying the ship all by herself. Not to mention, the Hulk didn't fight Thanos at all in this film. There are some choices made by the writers that some people don't agree with. If not Thor snapping Thanos away, he should have worked together with Marvel and the Hulk to hold him off, so Tony could later do it.Needless to say, time travel can be so convoluted because no rules are established here.﻿ Wouldn't Nebula killing her other self alter the future? Like what was stated by War Machine, they easily could have gone further back in time to kill Thanos as a baby. However, we wouldn't have had a great film had they chose to do that. There were so many different timelines explored in this movie. If you sit down and think long and hard about it, anyone can pick Act II apart. Furthermore,﻿ they didn't show much of Bucky with Captain America either. The real hero in this film was the mouse for accidentally bringing Ant-Man back. This scene would have been so much more believable had it shown a few homeless people messing around with the equipment. A mouse, really? Iron Man's sacrifice was duly noted along with Black Widow's. The Marvel movies had a fantastic run. For another positive, I liked Iron Man's short interaction with Spiderman. Next, when Capt. America grabbed the mjolnir and fought Thanos. Plus, the writers worked more to give Hawkeye a more in-depth character by showing his family. These were great, memorable scenes. All in all, it's still worth buying on BluRay.",2019-05-08,7,12,11,1,English

Cons: The film is incredibly dull and dark. Even in time travel everything was dim. My score is 8/10. In general, the film left a good impression. I advise to view!",2019-06-01,8,12,11,1,English

588,TheQuietGamer,"Delivers.Endgame is the epic conclusion to the battle against Thanks we were promised. An emotional conflict that sees The Avengers going from broken and forlorn, to reflexive, to strong again and everything in between. The power of seeing these characters go through this journey is the heart and soul of the movie, and is not to be under estimated. The majority of the three hour running time forsakes action to explore the effects Infinity War had on who these heroes have become, and yet it's no less exciting than anything that's come before.Some necessary, if minor improvements have been made that will help the MCU moving forward should Disney and Marvel stand firm in retaining this level of quality in future endeavors. For example, I've complained about subpar CGI in quite a few of these movies that seems to arise from a lack of effort being put in, rather than budgetary constraints. Here though there's not a lackluster visual to be found. I understand they realized the need to pull out all of the stops for this one and therefore phoned nothing in. A mentality that should be applied to every MCU film going forward.Brie Larson also improves in her role as Captain Marvel. She doesn't have much screen time at all, but what few scenes she does have show much more natural her performance is this time around. I'm beginning to retroactively feel that my issues with her acting in the standalone movie were more the result of the directors as opposed to the actress herself. The character of Danvers herself though could probably still use a little tweaking to make her likable though.Endgame also deals with darker content than one would expect from a MCU flick. On top of dealing with themes of hopelessness and regret stemming from how The Avengers defeat led to the deaths of so many, the violence is also quite shocking for a film of this nature. There's a decapitation right at the start of the movie and a perfectly visible slit throat for audiences to gawk at, among other bloody scenes. It's interesting to see stuff like this given the relatively wholesome nature these films have been known for and I'm curious to see what kind of content this opens the MCU on the big-screen up to in the future (they've been doing more graphic stuff like this on the television tie-ins for a while now).A lot of this movie is going to mean nothing to those who haven't followed this journey across the other 20 or so films that came before it. You might still get some entertainment from the humor and spectacle, but will be totally lost on who these people are, what's going on, and miss out on the real impact of Endgame. This is for the fans. For them it's an ending and a new beginning for a world they've been following for years now. With events that radically and forever change the face of cinema's first shared universe.9.3/10",2019-08-31,9,11,10,1,English
589,lager96,"Avengers: Endgame is the perfect culmination of 22 films that I, as well as countless others, have grown up with. This is a character film and takes a deep look at the characters that we have fallen in love with over the past eleven years. It takes its time which can affect the pacing but does it in a way where your time isn't being wasted as a viewer. Everything is important and makes the final scenes so emotional. The acting, editing, sound design, cinematography, &amp; directing are all on their A game and it shows. While this film does have some flaws, like the previously mentioned pacing, no one can deny this is a perfect end. The last hour is some of the most satisfying and emotional scenes you'll see in any comic book film.

Actually the only role for her is saving Iron man from a lonely death in space!! The other thing is the final battle, in my humble opinion, it was chaotic as same as White Walker battle in Game of Thrones, also the time travel was a bit hasty and unconvinced, especially in the way of retrieving the infinity stones.Anyway, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the final movie in the Avengers series, and its ending is a good way to say goodbye.",2019-08-07,7,11,10,1,English

Somewhat tellingly, I shed not a single tear... and I am usually an easy mark when it come to ""kicks to the feelz"".  Some great bits.

673,Alinzpark,"Avengers Endgame, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, ends the “Infinity Saga” of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a trail-blazing, wildly unpredictable manner; bringing 22 films of story to a towering, satisfying close.While the quality of MCU films have always spanned from mediocre to excellent, not even the best have  managed to break past being “really good for a superhero movies”. Luckily, Endgame finally bucks this trend.The Russos, who also directed last year’s Infinity War deserve all the recognition they can get for successfully putting a cap on 10+ years of character development in a way nobody predicted. The story is so experimental and unconventional, it was a bit unbelievable that it was a Marvel movie at times. Speaking of characters, the direction the movie takes certain heroes is incredibly shocking while never being arbitrary. Some decisions are hilarious, others are heartbreaking, but they all work incredibly well.A surprising highlight of the movie is actually Bruce Banner (aka. The Hulk). The twist that’s put on his character is not only dizzyingly hilarious, but also profoundly meaningful and, as always, the appeal of the character is helped along by a typically charismatic and likeable Mark Ruffalo performance.All performances are good, though, with Robert Downey Jr. in particular giving an incredible performance as Iron Man. With this being the finale of the saga, many actors  give incredible performances in their final appearances in the MCU.The film is far from light, though, as the latter half of the film is surprisingly gruelling; climaxing in an emotionally towering climax that is certain to please longtime fans. The film is absolutely not perfect, though, as there is a handful of uncharacteristically hamfisted moments pepper throughout; one scene in particular, which is clearly meant to be empowering, makes little sense and comes off as more pandering than anything.Also, while the film is largely entertaining, the film does feel a bit bloated at times and the surprisingly lengthy first act is incredibly slow moving and somber and is guaranteed to test some audiences’ patience.Overall, though, The MCU has pulled off something pretty amazing. It has ended 22 films of work in a way that is not only satisfying, but surprisingly experimental and groundbreaking. There is undoubtedly problems with endgame, but they are far from crippling and it’s worth marveling at what has been accomplished.",2019-06-17,7,10,9,1,English

773,BrunoVn00,"Marvel movies, specifically MCU movies just became really hard to review, because like I heard somewhere on the internet: This is not a movie...It's an event.Now sure, as an event it's fantastic. Full of fanservice and making every MCU fan finally getting what they always wanted makes this definitely a crowd-pleaser. I consider myself a fan of the MCU, but I'm also a fan of cinema in general...Which means that it's time to review it as an ACTUAL movie:The technical aspects are...Okay. The directing and cinematography are...Alright. I mean, they can't do much with that since almost the entire movie is CGI. Almost every shot has like a really strong depth-of-field blur that I just don't like...It makes the shots feel fake. Seriously, I don't think there is a single moment where I think that the sets look real. It's not incompetent, obviously, but the entire movie just looks so artificial. Now, props to the VFX team because, once again, they did a fantastic job, specially with Thanos, like the previous movie, but seriously, the overuse of CGI just makes everything look...Once again...Fake.Character development? What is that? There is none! Once again, just like Infinity War, with a HUGE cast of characters, it's basically impossible to give every character enough screentime and relevance to the plot and that's what happens here. Sure, you could argue that the characters have arcs and resolutions and I agree, but those arcs didn't start in this movie, started in five movies prior. There's a five year gap between Infinity War and Endgame and we just see the change of our main characters...Offscreen. That was lazy as hell, having character arcs...Offscreen. Hulk's character was the worst. We see him at the beggining being Bruce Banner, just like in the previous movie and then after the offscreen five year gap, we see him turned into Professor Hulk (or Smart Hulk whatever the hell it's called. Like, they never mention his name anyways). Literally a couple minutes passed and we see that sudden change. Things like those just seem like lazy writing. Speaking about lazy writing: Sorry but making a movie about time travel has a 99% chance of making something that doesn't make any sense or contradicts itself. Sure, we are supposed to suspend our disbelief as many MCU movies basically have the logic of a cartoon, but still, all this time travel stuff just left me wondering SOOO many things. Like, how is that you can't bring back a character that died? Didn't they established that if you take something from the past it doesn't affect your current timeline, just that timeline or some sh*t like that.The movie feels like it doesn't have a real threat throughout most of it. In the previous one we had Thanos from beggining to end. Here, we barely have Thanos. He now comes into the plot because the writers felt that they needed a big fight at the end. The way Thanos ends up appearing is just full of plot conveniences. Seriously, the writing, if you think about it, is so dumb. In the previous movie, Thanos was a very well developed villain with a clear motivation. Here, he changed his motivation and he just became the generic bad guy that just wants to destroy the universe. So lame.Of course among the genuinely positive things we have Alan Silvestri's score which might be the best score in any Avengers movie. We have the acting. This is arguably the best performance of the main cast (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth) in any Avengers movie ever. We have the pacing, which was really good because the movie constantly moved forward. It was three hours long but it never felt like it. It's a three hour long movie I could rewatch in its entirety at any time.Overall, as a MOVIE (in the filmmaking aspect) it is definitely a competent movie. Sure the writing is really dumb at times and the overuse of CGI might be a detriment, but pretty much the rest of the aspects are really solid. This feels like a great payoff. This feels like a satisfactory conclusion to this 22-movie franchise and the character resolutions were really well executed (even though one just makes me ask so many questions). I really enjoyed it because, like I said, I like watching MCU movies, but I need to stop wearing my fan glasses and admit the positives and negatives of the filmmaking aspect of this movie.",2019-04-30,7,13,11,2,English

780,rodsager,"This review is an edited for size, repost from one of my blogs on wordpress. https://evergreentimes.wordpress.com/2019/04/26/what-a-finale/  Avengers: Endgame was nothing short of brilliant; it is a masterpiece in the genre of super hero films and is good enough to transcend the action movie sphere.There were a great many reviews suggesting the movie was long. But was it? Making reference to its length tends to lead the reader to believe that it dragged on. This film does not drag on, not at all. Never once during the entire 181 minutes, yes friends that is a minute beyond the three-hour mark, did I get that feeling of ""this is a long movie."" Not one time. Is it a long movie? No, no it is not. It is a three-hour movie that blows by like a two-hour movie.I still can't wrap my head around everything they were able to convey without losing the audience and without overwhelming it either. I have to say that the scene stealing in this movie is from an unlikely character. The Hulk literally steals the show. Thor is amazing as well but he is not what you expect this go 'round.I will have to view it again to really soak it all in but I will say it was not a perfect film if there ever is such a thing. Hollywood loves to do stupid stuff and Endgame is no exception. Tony shows up in an Audi E-Tron which is an all-electric vehicle and it is like other electric vehicles, silent. The director decided to have a roaring engine noise dubbed over for ""effect."" But Audi's E-Tron badge is enormous and in no way subtle, so it is just STUPID to have it roaring in like that! There, that's my complaint ;)It is hard to compare Endgame to movies in the past as I have the advantage of having seen those films before versus when I walked out of the theater after seeing Ironman in 2008, there was no Avengers to compare it to. I was comparing it to the movies that had come before it. Ironman was the first of the 22 films in the Avengers MCU Saga. Part of how these movies rank in my view is how I felt about the film after first seeing it. But also it is about how I feel about it later on, even years later. I still love Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, THIRTY YEARS LATER! That is why that film still rates so high on my chart. This movie however is tough to gauge because it is not a stand alone story. It stands on the shoulders of 21 films that came before it. It is also in effect, a ""Part II"" of the Avengers Infinity War. I feel like a major shakeup is coming on how I view these films and the impact they have. There are better films than this one if we separate the films from their companion films and look only at its stand alone value. Part of what makes this movie so good is the reference we have from the previous 21 films. When we look at the film as part of the totality of effort across all the associated and supporting content, Endgame is absolutely, Top Tier. All by itself however, not as much. But therein lies the reality, it does get the benefit of those prior movies.I still feel that Guardians of the Galaxy flows better and is more ""fun."" But this movie isn't supposed to be fun, is it? Yet in spite of the gloomy atmosphere that is the post Thanos Infinity Stone apocalypse, this movie is in fact fun. The movie will pay homage to the 21 MCU films that preceded it with a variety of scenes scattered throughout. It is rare to see an action oriented film that can produce moist eyes from tears of both joy and sadness as well as laughs like it is a good stand up routine. The movie weaves the plots of previous films into this film using what is likely some cutting room footage and it all manages to tie together nicely. Although there are a few hopelessly predictable scenes and outcomes, there are some genuine twists in how the Avengers manage to try and ""undo"" what Thanos had done. During the process of ""fixing"" things, Marvel manages to create some amazing scenes that are homages to the past, the way past in fact.This movie feels like an end, it really does. Yes, I know there is a Spiderman movie this summer and there will be a Guardians of the Galaxy III and a whole ""Phase 4"" of MCU, but it is a bit of an end. This film genuinely wraps up the whole MCU into a delicious burrito, dripping with cheese, and soaked in spicy sauce. And we the audience, just ate it all up. In the immortal words of Porky Pig... ""Th-Th-The, Th-Th-The, Th-Th... That's all, folks."" There were no special scenes during or after the credits roll. There will never be another original ""Stan Lee"" cameo. There is an almost foreboding finality to it. This really brings to close what may someday go down as the greatest series of motion pictures ever made. 22 films over 11 years all collectively formed into one epic saga the likes of which we have never seen before. It is quite possible, we will never see anything like this again. WOW what a ride!

799,Gezzer,"Just got home after a late night screening. Man... long movie, but it didn't really feel like 3 hours had passed when it came to its conclusion. I definitely got caught up in it and over all enjoyed the movie.Is it perfect? Naw, not really. I won't spoil it, but it does have a few plot holes and contrived situations. But it is based on the Marvel universe, so a person has to give it a bit of slack for that reason alone. As well a couple ""twists"" were telegraphed to such an extent that only a fool wouldn't of seen what was coming. But I was entertained so I'll overlook those minor imperfections too.Of course it was pretty well acted considering the cast, and ever actor rose to the occasion admirably. Well except for Chris Hemsworth... he stole the thing. I consider him the highlight of the whole movie and his portrayal of a ""down and out"" Thor now rivals Reynolds Deadpool for me. If for no other reason a person needs to see the movie just to watch his performance.A good flick for the target audience of which I'm one. But if you're not a big fan of the superhero genre' don't go into this one expecting it to be any different then the others we've seen.

804,Tha_Lowkey_One,"Disappointed in the route they chose to go with this movie. Infinity War was a masterpiece that fully developed Thanos as the Mad Titan. With him beating down the Hulk, Thor, and killing Loki in the opening scene the stage is set that this is a real villain. He completed his mission beat the avengers and obtained the stones which he used to kill half of the universe. He even sacrificed his daughter in the process. All this leads into Endgame where he is easily killed  with not much of a fight in the first 20 minutes and has destroyed the stones he has worked so hard to get. It makes no sense. So instead of a movie that builds up to the defeat of Thanos and the team finding some way to bring back the others we are left with a cheap time travel plot. This was brought into the movie to give the audience a trip down memory lane revisiting old movies and for no other reason. The visuals are great as always just sucks they took what could of been an epic conclusion and turned into a popcorn flick with forced fan service forced emotional scenes and forced bad humor. This movie lacks the suspense, tension, pace, that Infinity War mastered.",2019-04-30,7,14,11,3,English
805,Fortifier,"In short, while the movie was very enjoyable and had it's golden moments of fan service, there were many things in this movie that prevented it from being a completely fulfilling conclusion to the franchise.I'm just going to list off everything this movie did right, and everything this movie did wrong and leave it at that;WHAT WENT RIGHT;- Unpredictability- Fan Service- Final Battle- Use of different method of time travel- Halkeye's family in the beginning- Not making Captain Marvel an absolute core to the movie since she only got recently introduced- Special effects- Good character closure (except Cap returning as an old man wasn't exactly necessary, and it would have been sweeter and more dramatic if he simply left with Peggy without a trace).WHAT WENT WRONG- Doesn't truly make sure of the 3 hour run time; a lot of it is empty or could have definitely be used for building up the ending more.- Very uneven pacing- Tries to be too funny and casual at times when humour and being casual is the exact opposite of what is necessary- Doesn't focus enough on the truly devastating affects of the snap enough to invoke anger, fear and hopeless into the audience- Hulk's character got completely butchered and side-lined- Thor being fat and a loser was unpredictable and funny for the first while, but a big mistake in the long run since it made all his scenes too funny and awkward- Quantun Realm Deus Ex Machina (it would have been cooler if Dr. Strange did send the Time Stone to the future for the Avengers to study and invent time travel tech from)",2019-04-30,7,14,11,3,English
806,he110me,"I cannot say this movie was a solid 7/10. Many parts of it were 10/10, especially the parts surrounding the core Avengers, but the blatant fanfiction-tier politically motivated inserts brought the movie down in many ways. EDIT: Metacritic, WTF are you doing to my new lines?--Minor Spoilers follow--First, the good: This movie brings a solid and satisfying conclusion to the stories of some of the main avengers, and felt like a proper send-off to some of the best characters. The acting was A+, the effects were par for a Marvel movie, and the overall plot felt like a good continuation of Infinity War. --The Mixed-- This was kind of expected, but the way to figure out how to beat the most powerful being in the universe who has control of all of space and time felt like a giant deus ex machina. SPOILER: it's time travel. The Bad: Apparently, the original plan was to not feature Captain Marvel, and it shows. Her inclusions in the movie come out of left field and ultimately don't add much to the story. There were also a few scenes that broke continuity who's only purpose seemed to be to feature a bunch of female characters kicking butt. It felt as if they were just tacking things on to check off some boxes so the media hounds don't give them negative reviews. These things can be done well, as we saw with movies like Rogue One, but it was not done well here. Finally, there's never a rebuttal to Thanos's theory that the universe needs to be culled in order to survive. This theory was presented so strongly in Infinity War that I had a few friends thinking ""yeah, you know? Thanos was right. Thanos is the true hero!"". This movie does nothing to change our minds about that. To follow up on my Captain Marvel review, I called it (...mostly): Captain marvel is so powerful she singlehandedly wins the final battle for the Avengers, but she doesn't defeat Thanos. Frankly, it was pretty satisfying to see Thanos punch her smug face and send her flying, especially considering that was the first blow she receives on-screen after unlocking her full power in the Captain Marvel movie.",2019-04-28,7,14,11,3,English
807,BeastJ18,"A very fun and fitting conclusion to a wildly successful saga. Its biggest problem is that it relies heavily on time travel, and while they try to explain it, they constantly break their own rules. Banner explained that when you change the past, it becomes your new present and future. And by returning the stones to their original universe, you cauterise that timeline. So why didn't Captain America staying in the past seriously affect the present? And how did he end up on that bench when you need to be stood on that platform to get back? Why did nobody bat an eyelid when Nebula didn't return when Natasha didn't? And Doctor Strange's 1 in 14,000,000 ""plan"" relied on the chance that a rat would release Lang 5 years in the future, and countless other unpredictable variables that they had no control over...To put it bluntly, the writing makes almost no sense. However, it succeeded in completing many character arcs, kept it interesting and creative the whole time and the dialogue exceeded the average Marvel movie. It was also accompanied by some nice direction, whether it was snappy editing for comedy, attractive cinematography for the more emotional scenes or to show the scale of the battlefield, in addition to having impressive production, sound design and visual effects.",2019-05-08,7,14,11,3,English
808,Fatosententia,"Just want to say that the film is quite good, but it has 2 problems, because of which the pleasure is lost when watching.Let's start with less meaningful - with one person, Brie Larson. This is an absolute misskast for a rather important (?) role. However, replacing CM with any other character would change little. All that she basically does in the film is how cool she is. Well, also earns a tug. Well, the character performed by Bree looks absolutely dead, because she has neither charisma, nor distinctive personal qualities.Okay, stop scolding Bree, because you can do this forever. The second, much more important issue of the film is an extremely weak scenario. Again, it is possible to explicate for an extremely long time what, how and why, but I’ll just say: the film introduces the possibility of traveling in time, without consequences. And this is the all-consuming ""black"" hole of the plot, because of which the meaning is lost in absolutely everything that comes through in the film. The flywheels of time compared to this is a children's toy.7/10, the film disappointed, but still allowed enough to spend an interesting 3 hours.",2019-04-29,7,14,11,3,English

816,MrElgin,"Firstly, I've liked the score this movie had taken on metacritic. Because, I think it's fair to give it 77 despite of to give 80 or more score. Because; it totally does not deserve the score they gave on this movie at IMDB. Secondly, it is not a bad movie and actually I liked this movie, however it can not be a cult for neither me nor the people who is not the fan of Marvel Cinematic/Comic Universe. Furthermore, I'm speaking with truth that I am a fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Even so, it couldn't change my score on this movie.If it is needed to say the reasons that I gave this score.1.From the very beginning of the movie to mid-break, it gives the feelings about how is the life after Infinity War and tells us which character doing what. Of course its telling level of tales is upper than some stage as usual, however it is not the best even if you look at in the whole corpus of Avengers.2.After mid-break things starts to move a li'l bit. And a humor that is above the average will wait you on this part.3.I can't tell what is exactly going on that scene because of the fact that it's a spoiler, but something that told by Bruce Banner in a very complicated manner at a very very li'l amount of time will be contradicts what is happening on the last scene of the movie. And again it is something about 'time' to give a clue for the folks who already watched the movie.4. The very best scene is I think the fight scene. And it is not a spoiler that there is a fight on this movie. Almost everything gets concluded on this part even I'm almost satisfied with this part.5.However, I want to ask to the producers, scenarists and directors of the whole hacking Hollywood that 'Why the hack that you intrude feminism on all movies. Yeah we understood there is also heroines, amazons and lots of armpit hair. So, you don't need to forcibly attached feminism and anti-racism on every single movie. We all know that women are worthy creatures just like men and we also can say it for the black and white and even for yellow what's more green people.'So if those 3rd and 5th reasons wouldn't be here I could give 80 point to this very high potentialed movie, however I'm telling it in mouth of gloom that I gave 70/100 on it.",2019-04-28,7,13,10,3,English
817,Ohhaimark34,"Overall, I enjoyed this follow-up to Infinity War, if not as much as its predecessor. First off, there is a lot of fanservice, and I mean a lot! Some of it is effective, including subtle references that pay tribute to past MCU films in creative ways that make you proud to have seen all the previous films. However, it also includes painfully corny scenes that are guaranteed to make you roll your eyes. The first thirty minutes or so are good, if a bit rushed and underplayed at certain times. Ultimately it is a solid start that grabs your attention and doesn’t let go. This first part is mostly to tie off any loose ends from Ininifty War, before we undergo a time jump, in order to show the calamity that the Thanos snap caused. This is an emotional, realistic and well-done start. From there, we get introduced to the main plot of the film, which involves reversing the effects of Infinity War. This is introduced a bit too quickly and conveniently in my opinion. From there, we spend a little time getting the band back together and seeing how other Avengers have been affected by the events of Infinity War. Several have changed, and quite frankly, they’ve done so for the better. Thor and Hulk are two standouts, as they’ve become more original, unique characters through the aftermath of Infinity War and what this film decided to do with them. This period begins the more lighthearted tone this film will have compared to Infinity War. I’m a bit lukewarm about the tone, considering how much I loved the dark tone of Infinity War, but it does suit the movie and it’s story. The humor is arguably one of the best parts of the movie. The jokes almost always land perfectly and the film has an excellent, natural sense of humor about it. The time travel is an iffy subject, as many movies fail to get it right, but this movie works with it well, despite getting a bit convoluted in its explanations. The execution of the time travel itself is nice and straightforward, designed to entertain as opposed to constantly trying to explain itself. This is the point in which the movie begins paying homage to past MCU films in fun and clever ways. These are also the moments in which the character interactions are the strongest. We get a variety of different tones throughout this middle act, from pure drama, to action, to even comed, and surprisingly enough, it all flows smoothly and in a watchable manner. This leads directly into the third act. The transition between the middle and the end is a bit rough, especially considering how different the two are. The third act ... is a tough one. It is essentially one giant final battle followed by a denouement. The battle is, well, it’s a lot. It’s hard not to feel like it’s overstuffed and the battle is just visually hard to follow. It’s certainly a more straightforward superhero action fight than I’m used to compared to the first two thirds of the film and Infinity War. The resolution of the battle however, is so immensely satisfying and clever, it’s hard not to feel like the whole thing is worth it. And, cue the waterworks. It wasn’t unexpected, but the finale of the film brings a huge toll for the MCU. No matter your expectations, the Russo Brothers know how to handle emotion, as clearly evident by almost everything in Infinity War, and this movie nails it, as far as emotion is concerned. The movie ends in a sort of bittersweet fashion, but one that’s incredibly well-directed, and hard to resist. Even the credits pay tribute to the 10+ years of the MCU in incredible fashion. All in all, even if at times, it struggles to sustain itself under its gigantic proportions, or fit itself into even the longest of superhero runtimes, Avengers Endgame is an emotionally impactful, satisfying thrill ride that knows what it needs to do and does it: entertain.",2019-04-29,7,13,10,3,English

Especially when it comes with the script, Endgame is a bunch of movies mashed together and it works (for the most part). They subvert our expectations in some good ways and bad ways, my biggest problem with this was what they did to Thanos. They kill the original in the first 10 minutes of the movie so the villain of this movie it's another Thanos from another timeline who doesn't have the same experience that the original Thanos has. And he is in this movie for 5 minutes or more. But I think this is my only problem with this movie, they really wasted Thanos which is the best villain (as of 2019) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This is a 180 minutes movie and it really doesn't feel like it is which is an awesome thing and the directors and screenwriters should be commended by it, they really did a good job, the movie is the most fan service and that is great, Cap using Thor hammer is one of the best scenes in this franchise.Overall Endgame is a great movie that tries to do too much but I still think that is one of the best Marvel movies only losing to Infinity War.",2019-04-28,7,14,10,4,English

Namely, Captain Marvel one shotting Thanos spaceship and later easily being thrown away by Thanos. Yet, even mundane characters could fight with Thanos on a similar strength for a while.

838,MovieGal2016,"Solid Marvel pic but too long.  The movie is definitely fun and a “must see” if you’re even a mild Marvel fan.  Yet, be warned there’s nothing new here and with all the hype I expected more.  The first two thirds of the movie are really slow and the plot feels labored and stale.  The last third of the movie is more interesting - yet, even there, the fights seem totally redundant.  Although I enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it, I feel like this movie reinforces the idea that Marvel needs a fresh approach going forward.  Also, I have to comment on the length of the movie, three hours with no intermission just doesn’t work.  At least a third of the viewers in our theater had to get up and take a break during the screening... viewers of all ages by the way... so, I’d like to see either a shorter cut of the movie or an intermission built in...  its very distracting when people are moving in/out of the theater.",2019-04-27,6,55,13,42,English

840,TrevorsView,"Thirty years ago, the critical and financial flop Howard the Duck was among the only comic book features from Stan Lee’s imagination. Then twenty years later, it took a total reversal to the capacity when Marvel has mastered the art of brainwashing people into numbly thinking their products, including their newest one, Avengers: Endgame, lands among the greatest Hollywood productions ever (just look at IMDb’s top 250 for crying out loud). But in truth, this is no different than anything else the MCU urinates, and yes, that includes The Incredible Hulk and Thor: The Dark World.The time travel genre of this finale to phase three explains plot holes by mocking similar movies, yet still winds up far more illogical than Back to the Future, The Terminator, Hot Tub Time Machine 2, and all others of such. The random sequence arrangement between the multiple heroes who jump through multiple places in time turns tedious, but not nearly as tedious as when they explain then re-explain stuff through massive information dumps that continue even after the climax. The atrocious script confuses the average viewer beyond wanting to care as it shoves aside an important character death two-thirds of the way through to make extra time for awkward jokes and boring exposition.The first joke happens in a very serious conversation where multiple lives are discussed as being at stake, then bam: Tony insults Rocket with intention to generate a chuckle. Among the more awkward jokes thrown around includes one of how nobody knows who Ant-Man is while everybody knows who the Hulk is. Except that joke doesn’t really work, not only because it has nothing to do with the plot, but mostly because everybody on earth now knows Ant-Man. This imbalance between drama and comedy is just chaos unworthy of celebration, which can’t even carry any intelligence throughout a sentimental San Francisco memorial for the Snap victims.Anyone deeply committed to the series could mostly likely by now be terribly sick of the cut-a-second editing and nauseating handheld camera, which here gets so bad it diminishes any impact of the bloated “sudden death” climax. Not to mention there’s drawn out music that never changes its style—a heavily American score that makes the already racist depiction of a Japanese assassin much more unacceptable. The music can’t even make a smooth transition between scenes, not that there could be one to start with, most of the “sad scenes” transition to upbeat scenes on a dime… at least Captain America 1990 stayed consistently cheesy.Out of complete fairness though, the problems of humanity start things off in this production as best as they can. It starts when Hawkeye’s daughter vanishes after an archery lesson, then develops it further as it shows how the dark fate of Tony seems to be booked, until Captain Marvel saves him. She’s in here for only a total of about two minutes, but Brie Larson has improved her horrendous performance from the last movie, which is enough to make the first two scenes of this movie relatively effective.In fact, all of the actors are better than before thanks to the more heartful attempts against urgent problems this studio wants to comment on. Mark Ruffalo is now at his funniest based off how high his character rises, as is Chris Hemsworth, based off how low his character drops. It’s like they both accepted the fact that they’re stuck in a skittles-level narrative, and it only took them eight years to finally make the most of it without phoning in their performances! That little motivation the Russo brothers express uplifts the somewhat brilliant comedic effect when watching clever flashbacks to previous movies, which triggers effective tension.Don’t be fooled though, those behind this production still willfully deny whatever trouble they caused, particularly in how much they dishonor our own spirituality. It’s easy to neglect the individuals within this three-hour blitz, considering they are impossible to count by now. Because Disney isn’t even trying to tell an actual story, Thanos‘ complexity disappears from his last appearance. The heroes honestly showed more layers of opinion and conflict without a villain, much like in one of the MCU’s finer films, Captain America: Civil War, it would be better to return to that level of risk-taking instead of this blatant fanservice.Geez, the deeper I review such a popular insult to art like Avengers: Endgame, the angrier I become about what some choose for fulfillment! It’s recommended not to support writers who crank out a billion dollars without even trying. Eventually their true colors will show, and ultimately reveal the wrong in giving up money to Mickey Mouse. If “you are what you watch” is true, then wasting three hours here will give the effect of a trash heap on those who worship the red logo.",2019-05-02,2,57,13,44,English
841,DanteXE,"22 movie has led to this garbage. Thank you MARVEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU FKING IDIOTS!I have Spider-Man tattoo in my whole arm, you know i'm a fanboy but this. this is just pure garbage movie.First of all, it's not even half of Infinity War.This movie is basically most expensive fan fiction movie of all time. All of the movie is just Star-Lord's Thanos slapping cheap. All of the motives, events everything is that much ridiculous.1) You fcking shove Captain Marvel into MCU before this. She is absent from movie. What the hell you forced her to MCU at this point. You don't need her.2)Everyone waiting for Hulk's revenge, but oh no! He is peacefull and powerless. It's not the same Hulk, he is shorter, smaller, and not powerfull as old one.3) You make Thor OP at IW, but oh no! He is fcking a loser now. He can't even hit a punch on Thanos. Everyone waiting for Thor but you wasted him. He killed Thanos with full Gauntlet but now he cant even hit stoneless Thanos. Bravo Marvel, f*cking Bravo.4)Some things should stay in comic pages. Comic has lots of ridiculous things. Captain America and Mjolnir is one of them. It's not working like that, that hammer won't go who ever calling it. You can't stay consistent with your rules. Also that idiot is not worthy, after everything happened Civil War and Infinity War is because of him. He is the biggest douchebag in MCU. Worthless bastard.5)Ant-Man's come back... All of the universe saved because of a rat. If there isn't a rat there all of the universe is just fked up...6)14 million possibilities and 1 success. It is really this one? If you saying this, i will look for all of the possibilities. You should make a ending with no other possiblities. But I can assure you the is a possibility there is Thor is not an idiot or Captain Marvel is actually usefull. Or Doctor Strange is just fking do something other than holding water... Marvel, you are just bunch of idiots you know. Hell, there should be a timeline that Thor hits Thanos' head or Ironman tooks stones and just runs, there is no need to use those but they should kill him you know, so he is used the stones... Captain Marvel can destroy that thrash can gauntlet with power, why the hell she didn't do that? Also why the fk Thanos did go to Nidavellir for Gauntlet? Stark can do this with Aluminium not even vibranium you know? And Hulk cried 5 hourse after stones but Ironman just talked with no problem...

They have all infinity stones + Hugo Strange that can heal any wounds with the time stone so his death made no sense.2. Thanos lost in a unfair match against Team Space in the last movie but in this one hes able to compete with everyone, even Thor that (might been out of shape) had both mjolnir and stormbreaker that could oneshot kill him.3. Mary Sue Marvel had no place in this movie, it hurt every moment she was on the screen.and at the ending where she came in saved everyone and could tank thanos attacks that beat the hulk into a coward because ""gurl power"". Really hoped she would die in this movie.4. Timetravel works if its parallell universes but Captain America deciding to stay in the past for some coochi was pretty bloody dumb and somehow still end up in the main time line?5. Thor giving the reigns to a random valkyrian. Thor is of noble blood and is suppose to sit on the throne, he cant just give it to a random valkyrian that havent been in asgard for over a million years. Would make more sense if he adopted earths democratic voting system instead.6. The girl power moment was cringe and out of place, and the scientist from black panther would have 100% died in a real war. 7. How did Ant-man survive a rocket that could destroy a whole house to the face?But the movie was still okey, but i think this will be the last avenger movie i will ever watch and just keep following Spider-man movies in the future.",2019-04-28,6,56,12,44,English

Then thanos gets wind of it and travels to their time. Then a big fight happens where there's tons of booms and such. Everyone was playing 'keep away' with the stones. Some people were put on a mantle *coughmostlythefemalescough* while a few people died on screen. Then one hero uses the stones to 'snap' away all of thanos's troops, this guy dies and everyone gets sad over it. There's some narration by the dead dude and all other heroes continue on their day to day activities. That was the whole movie sum'ed up and honestly? This whole movie just felt really cliche'd and average at best. I wasn't that invested in anything and I actually grown bored with all the drama and sob stories that was constantly occurring. The action scenes were too flashy and just all over the place and while there was some unexplained plotholes in the film and even a large amount of dangling threads, I honestly think they're just planning on explaining those things in a future film or something. Regardless, not worth seeing unless you are heavily invested in the Marvel franchise you might like the movie but as for me, a person not invested heavily in the Marvel Franchise?

This entire movie was trying to drag for so long and even the quasi emotional scenes just didnt do it for me. I felt nothing when Black Widow jumped to her death, which was one of the few parts of this movie that actually made sense, sacrificing someone dear to get the soulstone.But what it came down to is the cliched classic jump back in time travel plot, however it wasn't supposed to be like Back in the Future, so they say. But Captain America came back in the same time-line as an old man, so how is that not like Back in the Future?!?Also Captain Marvel was totally hyped, but didn't played much of a role in the entire movie, talk about overhyping it!You see I have been cheated.....and all of you aswell.",2019-04-28,4,53,11,42,English

868,Dazar,"Marvel fans, you have to come to the realization that these movies are not that great. In particular the humor. The  humor in the MCU has gotten horrible and always seems to show up when you would be experiencing something other than laughter (""I aimed for the head""). This is the primary reason I don't consider these movies to have any heart put behind them. I firmly believe that they follow a formula where there has to be a joke after a certain amount of time regardless if it kills the mood.On the  bright side, at least Thanos' goal made sense in this movie. The killing half the universe thing is stupid if you still allow what is left to reproduce, and since he had the kill set to randomize you were always going to have about a 50/50 split on the sexes. Thor, just why? He has been a pointless laughing stock since Ragnarok. Hulk was also a disappointment. If the comics are anything to go by, people in general don't like a fusion of Banner and Hulk, and generally it seemed it only existed due to the special limitation that they put into the Infinity Guantlet (which shouldn't have limitations and makes no sense to have any if Thanos was going to do with it in this movie what he wanted).

The middle of the movie REALLY dragged on.  My wife was actually glad she needed to use the bathroom so she'd have an excuse to step away.  My wife and I are big comic book hero fans, and actually collect comic books together, but we were off and on board throughout the middle 1.5 hrs of the film.  They have this ONE chance to turn everything around to bring back those they loved, but every 5-10 minutes, the cast are making light of their situation.  It just really ruined the immersion, and tension that SHOULD have been surrounding their perilous journey.  Captain Marvel/Brie Larson felt SO out of place in the film.  They literally threw her into every scene she was in, but it didn't feel as if she should be there.  There was no emotional connection to her at all even though she basically saved the Avengers.  The way the final battle went down up to the conclusion seemed rushed after having sat their for 2hr 45 min with little to no action.  After the final battle, the reminiscing sequence afterward lasted forever, and we were ready to leave once the battle concluded, but there's like 20 more minutes afterward that didn't feel needed.  Lastly, Ill only say that the sequence towards the end with Captain America passing on the reigns to another character was one of the biggest liberal pandering segments I have ever seen in a movie, and left a REAL bad taste in my mouth at the end.  Why can't films leave politics OUT.  So tired of it.  Anyway, I wanted to give the film a better score, but it simply doesn't deserve it.

Movie audiences are becoming more and more (numb, tolerant, enured) to mindless Hollywood spectacles like this, and unfortunately now so are the critics. If this is a standard for movie making, heaven help the movie industry. I can't help but compare it to Game of Thrones (last season not withstanding), and it fails miserably across all standards of comparison. I had absolutely no empathy for any of the characters, except maybe a bit for the bad guy (what was his name.. Thanos?) who seemed weary and forlorn.

886,WeAreVenom87,"Crazy disappointing is probably the best way I can describe this movie. I feel like giving it a 2, but to be fair a 6 is probably what it deserves. The reason I feel like giving this movie such a low score is because it was so hyped for so long building anticipation and then totally mailing it in. I admit I am a huge comic book fan and because of this I have seen every MCU movies with the exception of only making it about 75% of the way through Captain Marvel. I have become much more lenient on expecting movies to follow comic book plots and even encouraged change if I thought it was for the better. In this case they had a perfect example to adapt from in Jim Starlin's Infinity Gauntlet series. I already knew from the first part IW and due to contractual obligations these movies would be much different from the comics, but I was not expecting this. This movie throws away all the awesome scenes from the comic to replace them with lame callbacks to old movies, dragging characters through the mud like Thor and Hulk and setting things up for the ANAD Marvel characters in the future which are the worst of all the comic characters (Thanks Disney). The time travel plot was lame poorly executed and riddled this thing with plot holes. Most of the movie was boring and I felt no emotional investment. Characters I have loved fro more than 20 years died or had their final big moments in this film and I felt nothing because it was so poorly executed. I am not arrogant enough as a comic book fan to say I will never watch another MCU movie again with some of my favorite characters like Doctor Doom and the X-men joining, but I plan on skipping a lot of these until they prove to me they have their **** together.",2019-04-30,6,46,8,38,English

Moving on to Thanos.. He was there, but he wasn't really. The villain that Infinity War built is not there and even worse, he goes out of character claiming to destroy the Universe and how he will enjoy torturing Earth.

891,Jcondic,"Avengers Endgame feels like a movie where Marvel is patting itself on the back, good job! I don’t think there’s been a Marvel movie that has disappointed me more than this one. Last year’s Infinity War was great, everything was put together after ten years and it had a fantastic ending, a cliffhanger that had us all wanting more. The dramatic ending in infinity war is completely thrown away. Like my god, every real dramatic moment that was happening in Endgame was thrown away with humor. Literally would it be so bad for people to just be miserable, they toss in these stupid one liner’s in every scene, maybe its just me and I find it forced and not funny, but the obnoxious woman sitting behind me was cackling throughout. But really 5 years into the future the Hulk would still be dabbing? Really? Are people even dabbing now anymore? Captain America admiring his butt, Thor with anything he said, and Black Widow staring into the distance trying to cry for Clint while holding back a smile. Humor shouldn’t be used to take viewers out of uncomfortable situations, what’s the point of a dangerous battle for a viewer when they are constantly molded to feel safe with some joke to kill the seriousness. Let’s talk feminism and the pat on the back. During the big fight scene, they took time out to have all the woman stand together to fight Thanos, I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. Really? That’s showing how progressive marvel is, that shot is an insult considering only one of those women has been a lead in her own film. Marvel pat yourself on the back again, yay Girl Power and your trailblazing feminism.  That moment could’ve been so much better had they fought him and showcased their strengths, showing woman are equally good fighters to their male counterparts. Captain Marvel is one of the strongest super heroes in the whole MCU and she was probably on screen for ten minutes of the 3-hour runtime. But to literally have them come together during this massive fight for that shot is lazy filmmaking. I want one person to tell me they weren’t taken out of the film to consider all the woman were standing together. It killed the momentum in the battle. Risk and reward, Marvel/Disney usually doesn’t do well in this area. Star Wars Episode 8 was fantastic because things were at stake and viewers weren’t just given what they wanted, look at all the complaint they received for it. I really feel episode 9 will be like Endgame in that it gives viewers everything with little to no surprises. Endgame plays everything safe, even when situations are risky they are still safe. You know everything will turn out fine. Yes, there are a few deaths but nothing we weren’t expecting going in. And most of the deaths have already been reversed. Black Widow gets her own series on Disney+. The Characters, in the ten plus years and twenty plus movies, how many characters can you say have grown? Have changed with everything that has happened to them? No character has really felt or dealt with the fallout of anything that has happened to them in previous films. If they have it was for a short period of time because on the other side of the fallout the characters are right back where they started. On a side note with infinity war they finally made Thor cool. With this movie they took ten steps back and made him a dislikable character.I’ve always felt that superhero movies are only as good as their villains. (ex. Dark Knight, Spider man Homecoming) Infinity War made Thanos a great adversary with depth, he had purpose. Endgame made him a caricature of a villain we will forgot about after the credit’s role. That ending and another example of dumbing it down for audiences. The perfect ending would’ve been Steve Rogers going back in time and sitting on the park bench as an old man. Boom! there you go; the audience is smart enough to figure out what happened. Instead they drag the film for some talk between Cap and Falcon. Then they cut to show you where other characters are at and that everything will be okay. Everything is spelled out for the viewers so don’t fret we’re all in a happy place. Like my previous paragraph no one seemed to be affected by everything that happened. I could be wrong, but I guess we will see when the next phase of movies starts rolling out. Now don’t get me wrong there are moments and scenes in this movie I enjoyed. The time travel to the 70s with Cap and Iron man was great. It’s not all bad but the things I dislike are overshadowing the things I liked.The more days I sit with this film the more I dislike it and the hype machine it has become. There’s no substance to anything in this film. When I see people saying this should get nominated for an Oscar, I want people to ponder if they’ll remember anything about this movie in 10 years or even 1 year. In closing here’s one more pat on the back, congrats to the people at Marvel/Disney.",2019-05-07,3,47,8,39,English
892,iceman994,First of all the story is really boring. There are many scenes where u fallasleep. Also ironman and nebula rescue part is so weird and too fast and not explained well like they were in a hurry to make a short scene that they have been saved by Cpt Marvel. Really badly designed scene. Also no view about the civillians how they feel about their lost friends or families. Nothing we get only view from the avengers and only Earth. Another thing is that where Scott comes out from the quantum realm becuz this scene so fast and really not explained in any way. I know its a 3 hours long movie but sometimes if u cut the boring parts and replace with important part them everything will be okay. So the time travelling is a thing in many movies to fix a movie becuz the directors stupid to make a good movie. Now they split up to 3 groups to get the stones from the past but the biggest joke is they didnt try to get all from one time like before thanos snap. Thanos against thor surprise is really strong becuz he can kill Thanos. Why not travel back cut his arm and take the stones go back and thats all. But they choose the worst part to get the stones from the wrpng and complicated way. Also Thanos wasnt that great villain and the story badly explained about him the comics were way mich better than this idea. They used the bad time travel idea to kill Romanov. Also they use the stones in the end to kill tony stark. When Captain Marvel get the stones and able to snap and kill the villain but not she has a too stupid character. Also this movie killed 3 main characters to give it to the next generation and Captain Marvel character was so bad before and she will ruin the MCU and the others not enough good. Sorry Marvel thats not enough to be worthy like the comics. We got some villains and needed to kill 3 characters read the comics and checkout how many villains are there. Many acting were so bad sometimes they are forced ina scene to be there but totally not exist there.,2019-04-26,0,83,14,69,English
893,donald_s,"This is a hard review to write.  On the one hand Endgame has a number of exciting and unexpected scenes.  But I have never in my life been more disappointed with a movie.  First it's a full hour too long.  Lots of slow pacing trying to establish relationships that either were or should have been established 5 movies ago.  But the real problem with the film is it's inability to get you to suspend your disbelief.  Speculative fiction, science fiction and fantasy are anchored on a single idea.  There may be something fantastic, but it's internally consistent.  If I have a magic broom that lets me fly, it can't suddenly in the middle of story develop the ability to make pop tarts.  If it does, anything becomes possible and the story has no point.  Endgame is riddled with internal inconsistencies.  Because of that, suspending my disbelief became impossible.

899,GWF1987,"11 years and 20+ movies and it all builds up to a meh of a movie.It was average. The good parts were good, the bad parts were really, really badJokes were excessive in what should have been a dark film.Ant-man coming back after 5 years shows Marvel Studios don't even care about their own continuity. If 5 years in real life is only 5 hours in the Quantum Realm why was Janet old in Ant-man and the Wasp? People still mock the Martha scene from BvS but let's be honest, the ""Cap freezes up and stops fighting when someone mentions Bucky"" nonsense is way worse than the Martha scene. It's used AGAIN in this one. It's ridiculous.They borrow from Dragon Ball Z for how time travel works, that way they can mess with time with no repercussions.Widow's death was emotional manipulation, and ultimately felt forgettable after the fact. Tony's death was the only really good part of the movie because it felt like the right way to end it, especially knowing how the MCu started with Tony being a selfish playboy.Steve somehow can go back in time and live out his life and be old in the present, with no changes to the current timeline? It's so stupid. And he gives the Shield to Falcon? Ugh. They really are going full SJW with future movies, aren't they? Forgettable movie. It was average at best and as usual the critics show how biased they truly are where they call this movie ""Once in a generation"" when it's just another MCU movie that is meh at best. Rotten Tomatoes also shows the bias used to protect the scores of MCU movies (not just them deleting negative audience ratings for Captain Marvel but legit critic score they manipulate). One critic gave the film a 2/5 but their review was labelled as ""Fresh"". Mind you, a 2.5 for BvS was considered ""Rotten"". Amazing how that works, isn't it? How a 2/5 is Fresh but a higher rating is somehow rotten for a non-Disney comic movie? But there's no bias (sarcasm)They further ruin Hulk and Thor, and seeing Hulk dab had me ready to walk out of the theater. I gave this a higher score intially but remembering the dab brought my score down from a 4 to a 3Seeing Captain Marvel easily destroying a full powered Thanos and shrugging off his blow like it was nothing shows how big of a Mary Sue she's really going to be in future films. And I honestly believe before hey did a bunch of reshoots a few months ago she beat Thanos and saved the day, and after seeing reaction to her character and Larson's comments against a large chunk of their potential audience they changed it to Tony stopping Thanos with the stones to keep from alienating more of their fans with that shoehorned in character.This should have been the end of the MCU. But the franchise prints money because of people like the guy who made headlines for seeing Captain Marvel 116 times and the guy last year who saw Infinity War over 100 times in theaters. So bad to average movies will continue to dominate box offices, prompting other studios to follow suit, meaning the days of good filmmaking will continue to fade into memory",2019-04-27,3,61,10,51,English
900,ColeCreation,"Characters:Pushed an agenda with Brie LarsonCaptain Marvel ruins the only good scenes in the movie and also could have easily shortened it by a whole hour. The Hulk/ Bruce Banner's character arc was absent from the film. There is nothing of the Hulks character arc except that Bruce Banner got at peace with the Hulk and now is professor Hulk for some reason.Thor 's character was completely butchered. In the beginning of the movie he was silent, then suddenly has a random outburst and kills Thanos, afterwards in the future becomes a fat drunker that plays Fortnite all day. Not to mention that he stays this way for the rest of the film. This happening to the Thor, such a well built up character (besides Thor Dark World) is very disappointing to see. Especially since Thor was built up in Ragnorock and very crucial in Infinity War. His character ending up like this and the audience knowing he is stuck like this forever is very saddening. Loki, Heimdall, and the dead asguardians don't feel avenged.Iron man in space was major waste of time since the audience know his dragged out death scene on the Malano is for nothing. The audience know Iron man isn't going to die in space so having him sleep there like he is, is just a huge waste of time. To make this worse, instead of having Tony Stark and Nebula. A character is who is also stranded in space with him come up with a great plan to fix the ship so that they can get back to Earth. All they do is have the Mary Sue, Captain Marvel. Come out of nowhere, save them, and carry their ship back safely to Earth. This shows the viewer that there is only an agenda of feminism being shoved at them to love Captain Marvel. Tony Stark, who is one of the smartest characters in the MCU get saved like this. Whether it may have been a man or a woman makes no sense. There was no reason for him to be in space if he was just going to get rescued.Thanos, which was remarkably the best MCU villain to date was COMPLETELY ruined by bad writing. Since the first Avengers back in 2012 we get to see hints to Thanos and how powerful he is. Him sending the Chitari to New York, killing billions of people across the Universe, stealing Nebula from her parents, wanting all the stones for power, ect. In this movie when he was introduced everyone was hoping for the mad titan to be ready for them and have an epic battle but no. All we got was him getting ambushed, not prepared, and getting decapitated in once slice. This made the audience feel sorry for a Thanos. A being of immeasurable power and strength instead of feared. Now instead of the Avengers who easily killed Thanos, having a villain to fight. It left the audience thinking of only two options.  Having another villain to fight or going back in time fight a younger Thanos but still kill him easily since this one died with one attack.In the end fight scene when Captain Marvel comes in from who knows where. She end up pulling a Kirby from Brawl flying straight through Thanos' ship blowing up the whole thing, killing his army, and almost killing him. Of course Thanos' on the spot thinks of using the power stone to punch Captain Marvel away. They could never have Captain Marvel kill him because all the fans would riot after the movie especially since they Disney knows nobody likes her.Tone:The movies tone was all over the place. At times it would get sad and then suddenly hit you with a really bad joke(out of place comedy).Since the movie started off with a very sad tone once they started adding in comedy it took away the dramatic effect of the eventsThe movie was set up to be a dark film but had many ridiculous jokes and was very all over the placeOthers:Not a good finale for an 11 year build up and 45+ hours worth of filmsTime travel doesn't make much sense. Supposedly whatever is done in the past is its own universe and even if they change events in the past nothing changes in the future. Captain Marvel getting attacked by Thanos without the power stone and not taking any damage or flinching confirmed that she is a Mary Sue. Hulk getting the same amount of burns as Iron man make no sense.Thor is nerved to much even with both hammers.Even thought Banner is professor Hulk he never actually fights.Thor leaves his people for the Gaurdians of the Galaxy because reasons?Female super hero moment feminism is extremely obvious and very awkward.Doctor Strange is wasted and does nothing but transport everyone to the battlefield.Much longer than it needed to be.",2019-04-27,3,55,9,46,English

907,fastbake,"Speaking of Gomorrah, seeing her again was great, but they wasted it. TBH, Nebula was great and the stark contrast in the progression of her character, from her interactions with Tony at the very beginning to her and Gomorrah on Thanos’s ship, was really compelling. However, Gomorrah really disappointed me. She has so much depth and tension in her character and they explored it really well in Infinity War, when Quill tried to kill her, and in Guardians of the Galaxy, but in this one, she changed her mind about her father REAL quick and OFF SCREEN and was really a throwaway character despite the fact that her death was one of the true deaths of infinity war and one of the most beautifully tragic moments for Thanos and humanized him. If they aren’t going to bring her back and give her a real touching moment, then just give her an Easter egg like with Loki and Thor, which was a great moment and really hit the nostalgia. Which brings me to the biggest plot confusion of the movie, which I was thinking about the entire time - isn’t it really hard for a human to hold an infinity stone? They made a huge **** deal about it in Guardians of the Galaxy, and they talked mad **** about how powerful they were, and yet all 13 of the **** were tossing them around like nothing?Furthermore, giving the Hulk the first snap is a **** disgrace, but I’m biased because I hate the Hulk. Bruce and the Hulk combined, great for him, is an obvious culmination of the entire Hulk storyline as a final resolution to his constant warring over the two halves of him, but he’s not a compelling character, he has no depth and he’s pretty **** useless in battle, but he got the snap and survived because he’s super strong!!!! At that point in the movie I was thinking that the director’s were just like “let’s just give them all something so we can end this **** series and move the **** on”. On an aesthetic note, one thing that I thought was so great about Thor Ragnorak and Infinity War were the great, artistic, and cinematic moments when some big, movie changing **** was happening (Thor’s lightning scene jesus **** But Hulk’s snap was in that white ass, clinically lit room in such a tight shot, and you only know it worked because of **** Hawkeye, whose wife is calling him, who once again I will say I don’t give a singular **** about. It just seemed such a far cry from Thanos’s snap moment, and Iron Man’s final snap which were given the time and artistry that they deserved, considering they were LITERALLY movie changing scenes. Speaking of important, climactic scenes scenes, I feel like Captain Marvel wasn’t wonderfully incorporated. She seems to be a very divisive character, from people hating her standalone movie to the rumors that the cast hated Brie Larson, but honestly, if she could knock Thanos out and give him a fair fight, where was she this whole time? She is literally supposed to be the most powerful being in the universe, and she was on the sidelines for the majority of this movie. I will admit there were great scenes, like any Tony/Peter interaction and Cap finally getting his dance with Peggy. These are things that the fans of the MCU have probably been asking for since forever, and getting these moments was quite satisfying. However, Cap being able to wield Thor’s hammer, which happens in the comics and is quite a popular demand of the Russo brothers, was not well explained. Especially with all the **** that Thor went through, giving up this moment for him was a little bit devastating for a Thor fan, and ultimately made me feel like this movie did him SO **** DIRTY. Obviously that moment has its fans and it was pretty well done cinematically, but if Cap is holding Mjolnir, he has the power of Thor, making Thor pretty extraneous in this movie. Also, when was he deemed worthy (tbh I don’t love Cap and knowing all the **** Thor went through to get Mjolnir back when he wasn’t worthy it feels a little bit quick/rushed/convenient/lazy). I think that they could have left many things out (them listing time travel movies, as funny as that is, was at least 5 minutes of my life I could have gotten back) in favor of spending more time developing our last moments with these original Avengers that have shaped our modern conception of superheroes. I went in with incredibly high expectations, and this movie fell quite short of them, but honestly, it gave a lot of lip service to what the fans wanted, to a point where the movie just felt like funny clips strung together by a flimsy plot line. And it was a funny movie - to a point where every serious or dark or tragic movie was almost immediately undercut with levity. Ultimately I think this movie had to do too much and didn’t have the time or bandwidth to do it all perfectly, and I’ll miss all the original Avengers despite the failings of this movie.

To have Caps die as an old coward (choosing his gf over the lives he could've saved/impacted) and Iron Man dying a hero made me really conflicted. This film just really feels patronizing and insulting in a 3rd Matrix, Lost Finale/Seinfeld Finale kind of way. And it makes me VERY concerned for Star Wars Ep.9. The 3 hour length isn't what sours the experience. It's how much frivolity and sloppiness that plagues those 3 hours. Its ultimately very forgettable. Even the choppy slapped together editing seems to have lost interest half way through. Its a shame as I feel this was a dead end that Infinity Gauntlet created. There was no successful way out of that rabbits hole...And while Captain Marvel wasn't as integral as many fans feared, she still felt forced into the plot/film and actually served as a major disruption to the flow more than anything. I walked away from this film felling very ""meh"".",2019-04-26,6,50,8,42,English
910,ninjamammoth,The movie was quite a let down as compared to infinity war. I felt the movie was plagued by numerous plot holes. The movie also felt very sluggish as it progressed.

911,wowcon,"I have watched all of the MCU and watch videos about the comics. I loved infinity war and this movie is definitely inferior to it. End Game had so much more to cover and conclude and falls short for it. The pacing suffers, going way to fast at the beginning yet dragging in the middle and then rushing the end. Also many characters are thrown aside, or even destroyed for the sake of convenience and comedy. Thor was probably the worst example. His whole very tragic story of everyone he loves dying and his vengeance fate but in this movie he is a useless, fat loser who even loses the one thing that makes him unique to the other heros, his ability to wield mjolnir, which can now be wielded by captain, which is cool, but in a film that trashes on thor, makes him feel even more pathetic. And I love Thor but even in the cinema I was in, when they are having their serious fight with Thanos, people were laughing at Thor just because he was fat. And Hulk was also severely side lined. After they cut him out of infinity war, fans were expecting to see him return and smash in the final fight, but he doesn't because he is (weirdly smaller) smarter hulk with a broken arm! The other thing that made me roll my entire body in the cinema in cringe was the political elements. There was dead silence every time captain Marvel showed up and no clapping or cheering for the feminist moment in the final fight. The way I see it is nobody wants politics in your movies! They also scared me by making me think captain Marvel was going to save the day but she does get slapped around so it balances out, as all things should be. In summary, infinity war had a better villain, better pacing and more emotional impact but you will enjoy it if you ignore the political jokes (and Brie Larson) and plot holes",2019-04-27,6,50,8,42,English

913,ty92,This movie was way too slow and too long. I don't mind a movie that is slow if it has great dialogue and characters. But I'm not a huge fan of most of the superheroes in Avengers. I think to enjoy this movie you need to be deeply invested in all of them. The only interest I had was with Thanos. The problem is the Thanos we seen for most of this movie had very little knowledge of all the superheroes he was fighting. He obviously had no knowledge of what happened in Infinity Wars. So the fight scenes didn't have as much weight to them as they should have. This was the biggest problem I had with them using time travel. Also time travel has been done so many times it just felt cheap and lazy. I'm also not a fan of them making Thor fat and making Hulk more human like. They are trying to get rid of all the best male superheroes. They also killed off Iron Man. They are full on SJW's putting down male characters and trying to make the female ones look better. I can't stand this trend with Marvel. You also get a scene with all the women superheroes on screen at once. It's too in your face at this point for me. I like strong female leads like Wonder Woman if done right. But Marvel goes about it the wrong way. The ending had some cool action scenes with some cool CGI. But that doesn't make a movie good. It's something that can help compliment a movie if everything else is good. But this movie was terrible in my opinion.,2019-08-21,0,25,4,21,English

917,Lambo442,"This review contains spoilers...For a 3 hour movie there is surprisingly little action. Central characters like Thor and the Hulk did hardly anything and were just lame. Captain Marvel was supposed to be their knight in shining armour but she was hardly in it at all and at the end fails to best Thanos one on one, even though she's just blasted through the middle of a giant space cruiser. I really thought she would be his downfall. If you're going to hype her up that much, make sure she's really a solid element of the film. Too much dialogue, too many sentimental moments. Ending it on Tony's Stark's funeral was just a downer when really you wanted some real cathartic, happy times after the bleakness of Infinity War. It's not even clear how Stark gets the stones from Thanos as one minute they're lodged in this glove and then next minute Stark has them without you even knowing why. Annoying that Black Widow has to die and they couldn't figure out another way to get the soul stone. Hawkeye's rage filled murdering spree near the beginning feels kind of forced and weird. Stupid humour that went way over the top, like Thor becoming a complete loser. It was funny for the first five minutes but when you realised how much they'd nerfed his powers you just felt disappointed, especially after how badass he was in Ragnarok. He was almost discounted from contributing altogether and was just pathetic. Stark's banter with his daughter was just cringey. Why did hulk wearing the infinity gauntlet for 10 seconds manage to restore the earth again? That wasn't explained but maybe I missed it. This always happens, when the hype is so high things go the other way. Captain Marvel's movie was dire as well. For me, although DC have a worse track record, Marvel still haven't topped Wonder Woman. Their new joker movie looks top notch too. Just hoping Guardians 3 is good.",2019-04-29,3,57,9,48,English

WTF is that??? lmao also she's so forced and such a last minute addition that there are too many plot holes with her. she's busy saving other worlds??? really?? Thanos is the biggest villain in the universe and has annihilated countless worlds within her jurisdiction, so where the **** was she? why hadn't she ""handled"" Thanos already???--they did Thor DIRTYYY, technically the most powerful of the earth heros, and goes through his character arc of Jerk hero full of himself, the downfall and finally his rise and belief in his ""godhood"" and completing his circle of the Thor that's close to his comic counterpart and king of Asgard....to being a basic ""fat clown"" in this movie, as if thats not bad enough he gives up his kindgom cause ""girl power"" so we can have a black female leading ""norse gods"" cause that makes sense.--Hulk isn't even hulk, he's just a nerd making jokes and never gets his chance at redemption and a cool fight with Thanos.--Black widow is killed off without her even getting her solo movie after having been in the movies the past decade...--the time travel arc was lame as hell and was not original whatsoever--Story was all over the place and convoluted ASF.honestly there's so much more to go on about but I'm sick of writing, will just post my reviews and forget about this movie ASAP. the rest of the MCU doesn't interest me aside from Guardians, especially if Thor is gonna be the new ""leader"" lol",2019-04-27,4,45,7,38,English

922,AnneU922,"Disappointing. Movie ruined all the original characters, and 3 hours was not necessary (and don't bother sitting through the end credits to hear an audio clip).Black Widow was a bad-ass in all the movies,yet, they made her character teary-eyed and overly emotional in almost every scene. and she had no real fight scenes? What? And she wasn't even given a decent death scene, just drop to your death.Captain America - giving up the shield so easily, it's like a slap in our face that he regretted being Cap America -- and wait, how was he able to stay in the past. That would mean there were 2 Steve Rogers in that timeline. And why couldn't he tell Falcon, who's he married to. Duh, we ALL know. And what?? He was able to get Thor's hammer. NO way.Thor - another character, he was bad-ass in all other movies, then reduced in this movie as drunk, emotional idiot and renounced his ""throne"" because he's not a Leader. What?Hulk - he's suppose to be a genius too but this time he couldn't figure out Quantum Physics. But Scott Lang had the idea? AH?? What???Clint - all of sudden a murderer (of criminals) and he was able to take down cartels on his own? hmmm.. really?Fury and Hill - were reduced to cameo appearances.. UGH.

928,Skulb,"I had wowed never again to watch another movie with the hideously lazy Robert Downey Jr in it. I had wowed even more to never again watch another movie containing the even more lazy and awful Chris Pratt. Ditto for the abysmal Chris Evans, whose only job is to be ""handsome"". Ruffalo, Johanson, Hemsworth, Cumberbatch; this movie must contain all the laziest actors in the world. Well, Jeff Goldblum isn't in it, so I guess that's one positive. They even managed to either dig up Robert Redford, or reanimate him with computer graphics, to do yet another non-role, exactly as pointless and lame as his last twenty roles were.But above all I had wowed to not waste any more money on the Marvel garbage that they keep churning out, and which people seem to like for some inexplicable reason. So why did I find myself in the movie theater watching this absurdly dumb and tedious movie? Because I'm a moron. What other explanation can there be?If you can survive the bad actors and their incessant oneliners; of two general types: ""clever"" oneliners and ""funny"" oneliners, all the ""dialog"" this movie contains; the actual movie isn't so much a narrative as it is a collection of gags, drowned in special effects. The characters are nonexistent. There is sexy and ""funny"", big and ""funny"", green and ""funny"", young and ""funny"", and about 30 different variations of have breasts and ""funny"". Those last ones also have to prove that they are braver and better than the ones without breasts, as well as ""funny"". Because the movie wasn't boring enough, so we decided to lecture people about ""feminism"" again too. And these are all the characters the movie contains, and all reciting bad oneliners the entire movie long. I wanted to get up and leave after five minutes, yet did not. Moron, see?Other than that it is identical to the last boring Avengers movie, which I was smart enough to download for free and play in the background while doing something far more interesting with my time. They have simply imported Back to the Future and overlaid it on this movie. Hey, if the peasants will watch anything we vomit out, why not. right? The entire torment of a movie is a self-referential stew of all the reasons I hate Hollywood. And now I also hate Marvel.My favorite scene was easily the ""funeral"" of Tony Stark, the just ""funny"" character, obnoxiously played by Downing. The camera panned slowly through the crowd, and I had absolutely no idea who most of the characters were, but was clearly supposed to. Monica Geller's boyfriend from Friends even made an appearance for some reason, although that was never explained. Perhaps Friends was taking place in the Marvel ""universe"" all along. It was somewhere between pathetic and funny. I couldn't decide.And of course, violins for when we're supposed to feel sad, cellos for when we're supposed to feel even sadder, horns for when we're supposed to get excited, clarinets for when we're supposed to think something was funny and all the other cliches of Hollywood brainwashing they could come up with. So it's not just bad; it aggressively insults you. I am starting to think that they really do have some machine somewhere making these movies. I can't think of any other explanation. Humans could not make something this utterly soulless, could they? This movie is so insultingly bad on every single level that I cannot believe people actually like it. Are they putting stuff in the drinking water again? I have to ask...",2019-05-16,0,40,6,34,English
929,War_Tiger,"I loved infinity wars, and seen/liked nearly all of the other movies in the series. Unfortunately Endgame falls short in quite a few areas. I certainly don't mind a long movie, but that comes with the assumption that something is happening in that time. There was some good, but mostly a lot wrong with the movie which I'll break down.Pro:-For the most part the final fight scene is well done and visually exciting.-Tony Stark scene is sad, but ultimately a fitting end to his character arc.-Quite a few jokes, though perhaps this is unfitting for what is supposed to be an action film.Cons:- Captain Marvel completely ruins the pace and tone of the movie. Every scene she is in leaves you rolling your eyes. This Mary Sue character is so much stronger than every other character and avenger that while their entire team is trying to save one planet, she is off  saving ""thousands"" (in her words). Her story, and character is unconvincing, and she is so incredibly powerful that she upstages every other person in the movie. She destroys Thanos's battlecruiser (A ship the size of a small city) by literally flying through it with her fist. But not before being blasted by its cannons (And shrugging it off totally unaffected). The same cannons that had just annihilated the entire avengers compound into literal rubble. She then proceeds to eliminate half an army before fighting Thanos who has all infinity stones. Earlier Thor, Captain America, and Iron man all fight Thanos without the stones, and are beaten. Yet Thanos with the gauntlet is no match for her as she shrugs off a blow from him and laughs about it. I was worried by every scene with her leading up to this point that she was going to swoop down and single handedly save the day, which would completely invalidate the ""teamwork"" tone of the rest of the movie. I wouldn't be surprised if it was originally written that way but changed last minute.- Iron man and Nebula are floating out in space, and who comes in to save the day? Yes you guessed it. The incredible Captain Marvel. Super being who is able to fly through space unprotected (No need for oxygen) at apparently faster than light speeds, and has the omnipotent knowledge of exactly where these two were floating at somewhere in space. Tony Stark is supposed to be a super genius, and he has the help of an android. Yet they couldn't work together to create some solution to save themselves? No. Instead super being swoops in on a literal golden beam of light to save the day. Disappointing, emasculating and anti-climactic.- The time travel plot was pretty disappointing, and left a lot of loopholes. Such as thors hammer not being returned, and how changes in the past wouldn't affect the present. How they would be sent to an alternate universe. Well then I must point out that the original universe that thanos half destroyed would still persist, and upon returning the heroes would be sent to another universe which they would then change. It opens up so many holes in the story I don't have enough room to go on. Why time travel? 10 years of writing, millions of dollars, and they resort to that cliche? Very disappointing.- Thanos is ambushed and killed within the first 30 minutes of the movie. Really? Everyone going into the movie is expecting a secondary power to counter his, or a long build up and occasional conflicts with thanos or something of the sort. Instead he dies without a fight, the movie has no villain, and instead they spend 2 hours making jokes and playing up overly dramatic scenes.- Thanos himself was ruined as a character. He was the ultimate villain in the previous movie, but in this one he barely seen any screen time. He had no character development, and ultimately after a trivial struggle with every other avenger, he was brought down by Captain Super Being and her sidekick Scarlet Jedi.  Leaving him distracted just enough to let Tony Stark snatch the stones away under his nose.- Thor was ruined. Really sad what they did to him. He had so much passion and such a great story arc in and leading up to Infinity War. Then they turned him into a fat drunken clown. Literally making booze jokes through nearly every scene, being called fat jokes, and generally being worthless and unheroic. - Dr.Strange, perhaps one of my favorite avengers did nothing the whole movie but hold back a wave of water for a few minutes. - No post credits scene. Every single other movie had a final scene at the end of the credits, but not the final movie? Not even a joke reference? A dozen people stayed in the theatre I was in and were all audibly disappointed.Overall the movie was enjoyable through parts. But I feel like Disney is going to ruin the future marvel movies. I think Captain Marvel is a good indicator of what is coming ahead. Unrelatable super heroes with unbelievable powers flying through space and saving thousands of planets at a time. Honestly...What villain can even compete?",2019-04-27,4,47,7,40,English
930,emirbud,"The only plus to this movie, and the only reason for score 1 in stead of 0 is ... no, it is 0. The makers of this movie have failed miserably. It is difficult to make such a movie work, with so many characters, but they get an F nonetheless. They could have done a much better job. Let me repeat one thing about superhero movies. They are inherently dumb. The whole premise is just dumb - people with superpowers. But it's a wonderful fantasy - people with superpowers. That's why the creators must put in extra effort to mitigate the dumbness by making the best possible story. Some superhero movies do a better job at that than others. This one does not, and I rank it really low, along with 'Thor - The Dark World' and 'Batman - The Dark Knight Rises'. I shall only mention two things out of many, that make this movie so awful: Thor and Feminism. Let me address both. Thor, one of my favorite characters in Marvel comics and the great Dignitary, has generally been portrayed terribly in the movies - all of them, with the possible exception of Infinity War. First, he's been bland and a spoiled brat in Thor - part one, then he's a stupid, uninteresting oaf through a couple of movies, and then they start introducing clownish aspects to this character, which culminates catastrophically in this movie with fat, drunk, whiny, bum Thor. It is unforgivable. To make things even worse, they don't even let him get in a single blow against Thanos in the final battle. He just gets brutalized by Thanos, and Captain America basically takes over his supposed role, and battles Thanos properly. In the end, they put him with the Guardians of Galaxy. Since they are a bunch of clowns, he's should fit right in, but another problem there is that Chris Hemsworth is simply not funny. Maybe he could have been very good for the role of Thor, had they written the character properly, but he's no comedian, however hard he may try. I guess some people thought that he was very funny being shocked and zapped, he was not.As for the feminism: I like feminism. I also like a good sandwich, but if you shove it violently down my throat, I am going to hate that particular sandwich, and I'm going to hate you. I am talking about that scene during the final battle when ONLY female characters come together to support Captain Marvel in whatever she was trying to do, I don't care. If you desperately want to push societal issues in what is basically a lowbrow superhero movie, you should nonetheless try to make it less painfully obvious and stupid.MCU finale is a total fail.

931,Brent_Marchant,"While it's a definite improvement over its snoozy predecessor, this latest installment in the franchise gets some things right but misses the mark on others. It's refreshing to see a superhero film that doesn't place an overreliance on special effects and action sequences, choosing (wisely) to take a more human and personal approach to telling its story. It also deftly incorporates humor that actually works and in just the right amounts at just the right times. Where it fails, though, it comes up supremely disappointing, such as lazily drawing upon time-worn plot devices that show a lack of imagination, a closing sequence that goes on far too long, giving short shrift to a number of key characters and employing a screenplay that all too often assumes viewer awareness of material from previous installments in this and related franchises (a real problem if one hasn't seen all the movies in question, something that many other cinematic franchises have successfully managed to avoid).

936,jadejaws,"I wanted to like this movie. I truly did. I was disappointed with some poor writing in Infinity War and hoped this would repair some of that. It degraded to much worse.I cannot believe people in general are not disappointed with the depth of the story of these past 2 movies.Cons----The time travel is horribly inconsistent and all over the place. The only rules it follows are there are no rules but what we need for the very weak plot.-Characters are purposely watered down to advance the plot. Thor is the latest victim. Hulk was IW.-Scale. Somewhere,the Russos forgot or just genuinely do not care that all the heroes are not the same and have differing abilities.Some of them are regular humans and cannot take a punch from a super powered being or a rocket to the face.  Thanos with or without Gauntlet is inconsistently powered. Cannot stand against Scarlet Witch yet can against Thor powered Captain America and Thor with stormbreaker. I was glad to see Scarlet Witch utilized better, dont get me wrong, but please stick to some sort of power scale here.-Unnecessary Bad Humor. It would have been a better movie with a more flushed out battle giving each character their unique moment than making Fortnite and dapping jokes.-Terrible representation of characters. I was excited about Professor Hulk (from Toys and general promotion it was obvious) only to find no explanation for it and it was just a plot device to keep him out of the fight again.Thor was just a disgrace of a representation. I truly have no idea who thought this was a good idea. Making fun of depression and alcoholism and degrading Thor to this was just dumb. Everyone from Wakanda were just shoehorned into the movie. They had no special moments and were generally just pushed around. Emerging from the portal was their strongest moment.The only fight scene Black Widow had was against Clint. She had minimal role in the rest of the movie. Never truly did anything but die. Had no funeral whatsoever at the end like Tony and was forgotten.Spider-Man was nothing short of useless in this movie. Same can be said of Wasp, Groot, Drax and Star-Lord.Doctor Strange was kept busy with a flood as a plot device.-Clear agenda (that didnt work in the comics either)The ""girl power"" moment was unnecessary and cringe worthy. Forced moments like this are dis-genuine and transparent. Captain Marvel is just setup as a Mary Sue. Saves Iron Man/Nebula with no real story. Clearly overpowered in final battle. If this is the future of Marvel, it seems it is headed for some truly poor writing. A character who is basically the annoying kid you used to play Super Heroes with who made up powers as they went along so you could never win.She has no weaknesses and is basically more powerful than anyone because they decided she is. Nevermind, Shuri who was established as the smartest human in the MCU and her possibly emerging as IronHeart(also a genuinely more like-able actor)..Nope...we are going to go the 9 year old kid version of this. Oh...and of the people we have killed off in these movies, 2 of them are strong females who established themselves as likable heroes with distinct abilities and personalities.I have zero issue with female representation (would rather see She-Hulk introduced myself but that is personal), I do have an issue with poor writing and plot armor. Pros---Callbacks to the timeline.I enjoyed almost every scene with the throwback to the original Avengers movie. Thor visiting his mother was a good moment.Tony and his Dad were well done.-Rocket. Continues to be one of the best Marvel characters whose humor works.Overall, just an extreme disappointment. I thought the original Avengers and Ultron were very well written movies that setup the franchise. I do not feel much different that what happened with the transition from JJ Abrams to Rian Johnson than I do with the transition of Whedon to the Russos. Very poorly handled.I realize that these are Directors not writers, but the Directors decide what storylines get into the movie and which ones do not. Saves Tony Stark/Nebula for no reason whatsoever but a plot device and to push the agenda of Captain Marvel being the most powerful. Just knows that Tony is stranded in an infinite void of space to save him at the last minute.",2019-04-29,3,55,8,47,English
937,Quiet_Spark,"This movie feels both like it was written specifically to subvert expectations and by someone whose only MCU experience was reading the script for IW. The biggest bother for me was that every main character is suddenly the opposite of what they've been built to be: Stark is suddenly a selfless family man instead of a selfish A-hole, Cap is suddenly a selfish A-hole instead of a selfless warrior, Hulk has been completely nerfed, in Ragnarok Thor became the God he was always meant to be and then suddenly he is depressed, fat and shirks his duty onto some rando we just met, we still haven't been a given a single reason to care about Hawkeye(other than his godawful haircut) or Widow yet I'm expected to have an emotional reaction when Widow sacrifices herself, Antman is borderline bullied throughout the film despite coming up with how to defeat Thanos and Thanos became a brainless megalomaniac instead of the superbly written antihero he was in IW. The time travel plot was pure deus ex machina laziness and there is no way in hell the Tony Stark from the previous MCU movies would sacrifice himself like he did that just isn't who he is. If the goal was to shuffle out the old blood for new blood than they should have stuck with IW's ending which would have been a perfect setup for a whole new MCU. I gave it a zero because honestly the whole film seemed to be a lazy attempt to wrap up lose ends as quick as possible rather than giving fans a memorable ending to a decade worth of world building.",2019-05-04,0,42,6,36,English

948,iSimon420,"After the mind-blowingly stellar and near perfect Avengers: Infinity Wars, I went to see Avengers: EndGame and was severely disappointed. Despite an admirable performance by Robert Downey Jr, the rest of this trainwreck is easily the worst Marvel movie made in years. Horrid pacing and a non-existent script and the most cringe-worthy performance outshine the admittedly fantastic CGI and strong choreography. It goes to show that a movie even with triple AAA CGI and special effects will fall flat on its face without a coherent and strong script. The Hulk is made into an absolute joke in EndGame, and Thanos motivations are little different from the prequel, except worse. Chris Hemsworth's performance as an Alcoholic Thor destroys what little hope was left for this movie. To say Hemsworth's performance was cringe-worthy doesn't do the experience any justice. Outside of Robert Downey Jr, most of the actors felt flat and uninspired in Endgame. Little is different about the plot from Infinity War, except that Infinity War had a dark twist ending and compellingly developed the antagonist as a villain. In Endgame, Thanos just feels like a substandard cliche, ""I want to take over the world"" stereotype. Despite the phenomenal battle scenes and choreography, the robotic and lifeless performance from the rest of the cast, not to mention aggravatingly horrible jokes and cliches riddled throughout the picture destroy all credibility this film could have had. Its as if the film directors and screenwriters looked at all the elements that were prodigious about Infinity War and said to themselves, ""Who needs ANY of that when we can have cliches?""    Avengers: Infinity War is without a doubt the superior film, and Marvel would be wise to revisit its strongest aspects to improve on the sequel.",2019-05-05,0,43,6,37,English
949,JoeCool,"Don't be fooled by all the one-review account 10-scores, there was probably some sort of prize to be won if they gave this movie a 10. The truth is that the first hour of this movie is plain boring, I mean really boring. After half an hour it becomes clear that time travel is the way to go to set things right. Can you say major plot holes on the way? Presposterous plot followed by an hour of messy crap before they get into any kind of action. The ""comedy"" is sort of on par with Infinity War. More slapstick for those who enjoy that kind of thing. Chuckles here and there and thankfully not as awkwardly childish as Ragnarok.The war scenes were good, I mean really good. Thanos is nicely done again and the fights are really well done, as we've come to expect really even if deja-vu creeps into the picture more than once. A whole lot of things still don't make any sort of sense. Captain Marvel was pushed in there with twice the charisma compared to the movie with her name on it, but that's not really that big of an achievement. Not that those good scenes are an excuse to have to sit through three hours of movie. They could have easily taken off half an hour to an hour and simply have created a better experience. It's really just too long for what it's bringing to the table.Some characters retire and some die, that's something in the sense of closure for the MCU and things to come. It could have been worse I suppose but boredom was the real winner in the end. I was really glad to get out the theatre and that's not a good sign at all.Still it's not all bad, just slow, dumb and messy before they get to the sorta good stuff.

953,fordagame,"I am a bit amazed, that this movie has so high score from fans. I am huge fan of MCU and even movies which by some reason a lot of people thinks that are weak I have still liked. I like superheroes, I like idea behind them. There are movies with stronger stories, there are movies with stronger visual effects, but in general all of them are good..... up until Avengers Endgame. Can I say that I regret that I watched it? No... after all I wanted to see what they think about this, how Marvel see ending of Infinity Saga. Everything in this shared universe was build somehow with the idea of this movie and in the end we receive some strange comedy. The best thing in the movie was constant flow of stupid jokes from every character. It wasn't about superheroes anymore. Half of the characters received some strange ""development"" which totally change who they are and turn them either in whiny baby or in stupid nerd. Marvel constantly breaks the rule of time travelling which they put in the movie. They just try to explain something and in a few scenes after that they do something totally different it seems to be alright. But even this is not the problem.... the problem is time travel itself. This was more like they wanted to play some nostalgia on the viewers, than to build some story. Yea, its nice to remember all this good movies, but I WANTED to see some original story. I understand that it is hard always to create something original and totally different... but come on, that was final of 21 movies and 10 years of development and you was lazy to think for something different than Time Travel? We just go back in time and fix it. Human imagination is endless and you came wit this. Especially in comic books where multiverse is integral part of the universe, we just time travel and fix the wrong. I expected to see that 50% of all living forms remained in one universe while other 50% have be send in other multiverse or something like that. More complicated scenario, where of course we will save everyone, but it will have some interesting and logical explanation why. That plot was slap in the face for me. The weakest plot in all MCU in a movie which actually needed to show the best of it. And even not like the movie was that bad... it was watchable. There was good moments, good visual effects.  If it was for example some generic movie as Deadpool or Shazam or Ant-man... I would say ok, not the best plot, but nice movie, but not for Avengers, not after all this year. It just needed to be much much more, they could do it, we deserved it. The way they retire old avengers was ridiculous. As Marvel itself said, everything should come to an end, but their end should be Infinity wars, not this... they really make one step after the end and break everything beautiful in it. So I would personally put even lower score, because they have failed to make a good ending, but after all if we forget about the story (which actually for me was the biggest part of the score) it was good movie as quality.

964,ilovethor,This movie was okay. I am in love with thor because hes super awesome and sexy and captain america sucks i hate him hes so annoying. I was very disappointed with this movie because thor was fat and not sexy for almost the entire movie he barely fought. I almost cried when that idiot captain america was able to pick up thors hammer but i was even more mad when his eyes turned blue and he could do the lightning thing. Thor is way more awesome than captain america and in avengers end game it didnt seem like it. It was more of a comedy than an action and adventure movie. The ending was sad because my third favourite avenger iron man died I rly rly rly wish that it was captain america instead. But anyways thor is just super awesome and it would have been fine if he was fat for a bit then he was sexy and awesome again at the end for the fight scene but no he was fat and not awesome the entire time. I was super excited to see thor be all awesome and his eyes turn blue and lightning strikes everywhere like when he came into wakanda in infinity war but nooooo he was fat and not sexy. And also i didnt like captain marvels haircut and the first 2 hours of the movie suck and i wish that they at least made all the superheros awesome for the end. But instead they made everyone but the strongest avenger (thor) awesome. And i also like black panther and he was in it for like two seconds and i love tom holland and he was cute in it but he was only in it for like two seconds. So pretty much thor rules captain america drools but for some reason they made thor fat and not awesome at fighting and not sexy the whole movie so im very upset but obviously i still love thor with all my heart chris hemsworth is the sexiest man alive,2019-04-26,4,46,6,40,English
965,joechip,"It's the hype that kills you.......after Marvel took some brave risks with IW which gave provided the film with substance and emotional gravitas, they directors, unsurprisingly, chose to unwind all of that and essentially, with the exception of the death of Iron Man, return everything to the status quo (yawn). The most interesting character from IW was Thanos, who, rarely for a Marvel villain, had a clear motive and was an emotionally complex character whose obsession with his own destiny destroyed everything he loved, in the name of 'saving' the universe. Interesting stuff. So do the writers do? they kill him off in the first few minutes, only to bring him back via time travel, which results in the Thanos of this film becoming another caricature of a villain; this Thanos has not been through the Trauma of sacrificing his own daughter, or through the hard graft of travelling across the galaxy to acquire the infinity stones. He's just another over-powered villain here. They should have found a more creative way to make the 'original' Thanos a viable threat, which would have forced the writers to come up with a more imaginative way of tackling Thanos for the second time, instead of using brute force in (another) final battle sequence. The humour was pitched at just the right level in IW, there's even more of it here and as such the film is tonally confused and feels more like Thor:Ragnarok than a sequel to IW. Captain Marvel is also grossly underused, especially after the not-so-subtle hint and the end of that film that she was going to play a part in Endgame. The time travel plot is incredibly inelegant and I'm still not sure on the logic that it doesn't really matter what you do in the past because it won't affect the future anyway? It was a device solely used to revisit some of the old Marvel movies, which is shameless fan service but I'm not necessarily against fan service and I'm sure it was a fun nostalgia trip for a lot of people. The filmmakers also do not really explore what life is like on Earth post Thanos' eradication of half of life on the planet - yes it's quieter and people are still sad, but there was a real chance to explore some interesting questions as to whether there was any (admittedly brutal) sense in what Thanos was trying to achieve (there is a moment where Cap comments that a pod of dolphins were seen because the rivers are less polluted due to less human traffic, but that is quickly quashed). However I appreciate most Marvel fans are not paying to see an intelligent comment on the problem of overpopulation. So what does this all add up to? an average Marvel movie where there are no real surprises or deviation from the standard formula. IW was by far a superior film but any sense of venturing into the unknown that IW established was quickly eradicated by a click of the studio's fingers.....",2019-05-02,3,39,5,34,English

967,DefinitelyMayb,"Avengers:End game is by far a much better film than Infinity War. More structured and more cohesive than the mess that was IW. That being said, I think the film is a very good conclusion to the last 10 year journey, which I have been part of since watching the first Iron Man during my high school days. What I loved about the film was that it took a lot of risks and some much needed character conclusion to their arks. In a funny world, these characters would have survived indefinitely and continue to rake in millions of dollars for the Disney overlords, but I must commend Kevin Fegie, the directors and screenwriters to actually end most of their storylines. A lot of care was taken in terms of the direction of the characters and what this film would end. The meta aspects of this film was particularly satisfying with those who have followed all the films will enjoy the subversions offered throughout this 3 hour epic. That said this film is far from perfect, with many of the same flaws still very much present.First, despite its epicness, much of the films drag into 3 distinct sections that I don't think add to being a very good cinematic experience. One massive annoyance is the tonal fluctations that seem to drag this movie down much like in IW. For example, in the first Act which reflects on the aftermath of Thanos's successful plan, we get some really dramatic scenes, then suddenly we get the usual MCU exposition/comedy scenes all fitted within adjacent to one another. One moment Black widows talking about something serious, and then another character talks about peanut butter sandwhiches. This is one of the painful things about the recent MCU films is the lack of dedication to the more dramatic aspects of their situation. First act on repeat viewings would have the feeling on dragging on because pretty much no action takes place. Another problem is that despite having these character moments, I dont think the film does a good job exploring these characters properly and in fact, there is little introspective of the sitatuion. We get to see for example, Captain America talk about how to move on in some sort of help group, but then we get little world-building of the tragedy that occured during IW. One thing I keep saying is that as the MCU keeps getting bigger and expanding, the world keeps feeling smaller and indifferent. For example, where is the military, why doesnt the film show what happens to the governments in Earth and other parts, where is Thunderbolt Ross, Martin Freeman's character, what about the villains? etc. We get very little of this but only a focus on the Avengers who lets face it, don;t really do much or is needed. Another poor thing that becomes apparent with the MCU is the lack of any villains/antagonists that are developed or survive long enough to be part of this. It feels like a missed opportunity in this film to actually get a sense of a bigger world at large. The movie then becomes a time travel/heist movie that is actually the most enjoyable. Despite some nitpicky time travel issues, I think this part was the most interesting and definitely the most worth in repeat viewings. However, this again was not a lot of actions and the characters splitting up made only some duos more interesting (ie Cap and Iron Man), whereas the pair of Black Widow/Hawkeye &amp; WarMachine/Nebula were definitely boring and generic. There is also a lot of conveniences in this film which becomes more noticable on repeat viewings. The final act, is a massive fight and deeply rewarding on an action perspective. Whilst it is good, its certainly still not as good as the Russo's brothers previous efforts. WE get glimpses of all the good characters fighting and there are some genuinely jaw dropping moments such as Captain America picking up Mjolinir and the avengers assembling for the final fight. Lots of CGI which is a mix big unfortunately.That being said, this was a much enjoyable film. The mixed feeling/score is reflective on the lack of cinematic quality and annoyance in that the film does many good stuff, but then is let down on other crucial aspects. Other things such as handing the mantle to Falcon, lack of emotional scene for Black Widow become bug bears on repeat viewings. Overall, this was still a satisfying experience, but for the sake of MCU, I hope they improve on the story and characters more in the future endeavours and be more like Winter Soldier, First Iron Man and Civil War which I think still are their best films.",2019-04-27,6,47,6,41,English
968,egoBorder,"Considering how much I enjoyed Infinity War, I was surprised by how disappointing Endgame was.  Not a bad movie by far, and some of the things that bothered me won't be an issue for others, but I expected more.  With that said, the beginning and ending are the best parts, so you'll likely leave the theatre happy (even if the movie doesn't sit too well as you digest it).I was surprised by the amount of humor.  And even though I thought the jokes mostly landed, it was weird that in a universe where half of sentient life disappeared there are so many people cracking jokes.  I would have appreciated a darker humor until the snap is reversed.  I just felt it undercut the stakes and loss the characters would be feeling after their defeat in the last movie, even if a bit of levity is needed for the audience's sake.The thing that bothered me the most was the reliance of time travel as a plot device.  I can accept time travel if it's just kind of in the background, but the moment a movie tries to make it seem real is the moment I can't accept it anymore.  The worst part of Endgame is that despite telling myself several times, ""Just ignore it and have fun!"" the movie spends a lot of screen time on the time travel plot and is constantly trying to justify it.  In the end I couldn't get past it and it made the middle of the movie really sag.",2019-04-28,6,48,6,42,English

972,Xan_Ryil,"Thanos finished the world, understandable, but why that long face? Everyone knew from the start that world was going to come back (and with new hair styles) so why spend first 60 minutes being so serious?They followed the formula all 2-part movies do (Kill Bill Vol-1/2, Harry Potter and Deathly Hollow 1/ 2) where first part is all about action and next one a lot drama with action in the end. Lesser known avengers could sue Thanos for discrimination as he left most famous Avengers to undo what he had done. But in the same way, Thanos can sue Disney and Marvel for strategically delaying Captain Marvel Movie Hence Captain Marvel was kind of immune to the disintegration phenomenon. Not only that but every single Avenger was saved with no serious injury in a massive missile attack by Thanos just before the final better. So was Antman who was in Quantam Realm, strangely 5 years were only 5 hours to him, but not to the Wasp who stayed there for some 30 years but aged 300 years which should have been 30 hours only.Logic behind saving the world was so grossly cliché and confusing that most of the time it was hard to catch up. Introduction of time machine and promise to not engage with past selves or play with the thread of time was so lame. Eventually they had to come up with the most stupid reasons to fill up the black holes they created in their stories. Like previous movie, End game has infinite stares. In an action packed movie where every response is predicted, a serious focus on a character and his dense stare feels awkward. Infused drama about every character, we know how much everyone thrives for science yet they refuse in the start to only come up with the solution in snap of a finger. Be it Bruce Banner or Tony Stark. Greatest science inventions like time machine are shown to be as easy as boiling eggs. Time travel not only revives dead and disintegrated characters but makes avengers even more strong. I wondered if they thought to go back in time and fix 9/11.Since writers were extremely lazy while developing the idea for the movie and could not weave in all the events in the past with their retrospective effects, they brought in an alternate reality approach so that they could mess up other realities to save the one they are in. And avengers in other realities are so lazy and sacrificing that they didn’t lift a finger to save their realities because Disney was not making movie about their reality.Character profile and development is perhaps strongest if we minus the excessive drama. Tony and Captain get the strongest storyline. Natasha’s departure and response by rest of avengers was perhaps forced into the story. All these years and no one knew if she had a family? What kind of friendship they have? Finally, the most commercial idea of passing Captain America’s shield (franchise torch) to someone colored. There was a Wonder Woman moment when all females assembled to secure Captain Marvel’s trip to time machine. Special effects are nothing new and same goes for the weird creatures.End Game might try to invoke that feeling which you have when a very long series end but it infuses more drama and action it actually needed and the ending in every possible way was predictable and weak.",2019-05-02,5,25,3,22,English

I would have given it a much higher score regardless, if Marvel hadn't put their political agenda's in the film. -They have a scene where they throw in a gay character with absolutely no benefit to the movie, then never seen again. -Then there was Brie Larson at it again. Thank goodness they gave her barely any screen time. Unfortunately that was too much screen time. Every comment she made was condescending, arrogant, and annoying. Terrible Character. Marvel should have definitely used this movie as a way to kill her off from the series. -Then this obsession with empowering all the female characters. In fact they have this one horrible scene where Captain Marvel is trying to get the gauntlet through Thanos' army and only all the female character line up together to protect the gauntlet and back her up. I could totally imagine a ""Girl Power"" banner in the background. I did a face palm in the theater.-Going along with empowering females, they also make the male characters useless. Hulk is worse in this movie then he was Infinity War, except now they also screwed up Thor. Besides Iron Man, Thor was the only other person who deserved to win this. He sacrificed the most, he lost the most, he suffered the most, yet here they make him a fat, alcoholic, useless, and unmotivated character full of insecurities. He didn't get any redemption nor satisfaction, in fact he gave away what he already had (such as the visions and coming in to save the day in Infinity Wars).-The rest of the male characters where all very submissive and weak around the females while the women acted strong and NEVER once showed any weakness.-They ruin this movie with PC cultural and Feminism once again (not sure why they haven't learned from the Captain Marvel flop).

From IW when Thor had an amazing journey, he is just embarrassing in this. And Hulk whose MO is losing his **** and smashing things up is suddenly all touchy feely - what the hell. It's almost like there is some kind of agenda in needing to clip the wings of the old guard before the next phase.The time travel feels silly and gimmicky and nothing more than self indulgent fan service. They effectively ape IW by having the Avengers go on a stone search just like Thanos did in IW. It makes scenes such as that on Vormire have little or no tension because we saw it all in the other film.Tony and Steve's arc doesn't get any decent closure with Tony reverting to the self absorbed douche bag that he was when the series started and Steve being his effective verbal whipping boy. All the efforts to make Thanos engaging and empathetic are cast aside so that the journey we saw him go on in IW is just thrown in the trash and we are given the 2014 Thanos who is just a cardboard cut out evil bad guy. This isn't the guy that we saw in IW who made the sacrifice on Vormire and could empathise with Scarlet Witch.For no reason whatsoever, he has decided against his life goal of a 50% cull of the universe to complete annihilation of everything even though he hasn't had the opportunity to experience the 'fruits' of his cull. He is also now ridiculously over powered. In IW, Stormbreaker nearly kills Thanos when he has all six stones yet in Endgame, he has no stones or gauntlet and Thor can't mortally damage him with Stormbreaker AND Mjolnir.I've seen many try to dismiss these as easily explainable plot holes but the reality is that they are just lazy writing and pretentious directing. Seemingly the makers got themselves into a hole with a fearsome yet sympathetic bad guy, cooked up a time travel device that created nothing but a slew of contradictions, removed the straight line linearity of IW, invested all the money in a final battle that looked like an over inflated DC mess rather than matching the clear and beautifully simple fights/battles from IW and felt the need to hobble some of the biggest characters to signal their social justice virtue.This disappointment of a film which must rank as the Russo's worst MCU film smacks of what happened with Joss Whedon and the Ultron film. Too much pressure and studio meddling , straight jacketed by a dose of political correctness and a loss of stand out creativity to be patched over with fan pleasing guff.Given the Russo's previous stellar work, I expected this to be sure fire hit but what I got was a hot mess of a film that tried to tie things up but rendered itself a little vanilla in doing so.

It had way too much going on, got bogged down in too many needless scenes that dragged too long and poorly told jokes that did not stick like they usually do.The final battle did not have nearly as much action as expected.  And since it was against time-travel Thanos it really didn't feel like it was against the real Thanos from Infinity War.  A missed opportunity.The Russo Brothers said they wanted to dedicate this one to the fans.  If you want to please the fans, then make a great movie.",2019-04-30,6,29,3,26,English
986,Krossbone,"Ah, Avengers: Endgame. The movie that the world was waiting for for about 10 years now? Anyways, let's get straight to the point. This movie is an extremely mixed bag for me. While there's many moments in here that are just breath-taking and badass, there's also a large number of scenes that just had me cringing.First off, let's go over the positives. For anyone who has watched the movie, you know how awesome it was to see Captain America pick up Mjolnir and wail on Thanos. It was a very awe-inspiring scene and was just overall REALLY a fun watch. Similarly to this but with more consequence, when Iron Man acquired the Infinity Stones and snapped Thanos' forces away, that was also just as if not possibly more epic than Capt. America's feat of fighting Thanos with Mjolnir. Was also fun to see Ant-Man knock down a Chitari flying whale with just his giant form, but that's just me fanboying Ant-Man.Another positive is the character arcs that both Capt. America and Iron Man go through over the course of the movie as they re-meet old friends and family as they travel across time trying to re-acquire the Infinity Stones. Now onto the negatives, and oh boy is there a bit to cover.First off, this movie, no matter how many people might tell you otherwise, is FULL of SJW moments very clearly. Let's list them off, shall we?:1. Thor, the white male that he is, has grown to be a lardy alcoholic in this movie that apparently can't even take on base Thanos while Capt. Marvel can effortlessly tank a headbutt from Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet? Nice clear SJWism.2. During the middle of the fight with Thanos, a bunch of the superwomen gather up together and start to wail on Thanos' forces, while all the men're just sitting in the sidelines like a bunch of sissies. This just goes to show the same ol', same ol' trope of ""GIRL POWERRRR!"" in modern Mary Sue-filled movies.3. Another showing of feminist/SJW propaganda in this movie is Thor just randomly handing off the title of king of Asgard to the random Valkyrie chick we met and saw only a few movies ago. All of that after seeing him become a tub of lard? His character ruined? It's quite pathetic what they did to him, now he just runs around with the Guardians of the Galaxy and'll do who knows what for who knows how long.4. Capt. America handing off the title of, well, Capt. America to a black guy, specifically Falcon, is another showing of stupid disregard for character in exchange for blatant SJW propaganda. Honestly, it's completely out-of-character for Steve to hand out the shield to Falcon instead of Bucky. He very clearly has a much bigger and better relationship with Bucky, so why hand it to Falcon? It's just dumb and completely takes you out of the otherwise surreal experience of seeing Cap as an oldie.I could go on and on about why SJWism is what's ruining this movie, but it has flaws even aside from that. The movie is very uneventful, and very boring as a result. Many a moment, I'd find myself just wanting the movie to be over so I could take a bathroom break. And many of my friends have made the same claims. It's just not as fun to watch as the other movies, minus those few moments Cap and Iron Man had near the end of the film (but we know what happened to both of them, now don't we?).If you just want to finish off the Marvel movies with a bit of a banger, this is the movie for you. It has some badass moments for many fan favs like Cap and Iron Man, and really builds up the fanservice with the final fight.All this considered however, the movie is absolutely LITTERED with SJW garbage that really detracts from the experience for someone with more right-leaning viewpoints. If you're one of those kinda people like me, do or don't see this movie, but most certainly avoid the assuredly SJW phase 4 of the MCU Marvel Studios will be churning out in the not-so-distant future.",2019-04-29,5,29,3,26,English
987,cheeseburgers,"The best way to describe Endgame is chaotic which is expected when a movie tries to bring together so many characters. However, many sub-plot lines seem shoehorned. Captain Americas demise seemed strange, and really didn't fit the movie. How Iron Man managed to take the stones off of the glove at the end didn't make sense. Captain America coming in and destroying the entire enemy ship as if it were butter, I mean come on, had she shown up 10 minutes sooner there would not have been any fight. That should be a sign of a character that is too OP. Thanos is initially able to throw Captain Marvel aside, then tries again and isn't able to without the power stone. The evil nebula dying without killing a single character. Thanos refusing to finish off any of iron man, thor, or captain america even though he indicated that it was personal now. He literally just stood there for a minute doing nothing until the reinforcements showed up. Thor, captain america, and iron man were unable to defeat thanos without him even having the stones? It seemed like the 3 of them together would've been able to pull it off in infinity war if thanos hadn't had the stones yet. These are just the plot holes I can remember 3 days after watching.The pacing of the movie was herky jerky as well. I was yawning in the theater for the first 45 minutes of the movie. Some parts were just too slow and drawn out. Finally, if you're going to kill off captain america and iron man, they should have killed thor as well to wrap it all up cleanly. Not only that, but let the legacy of the characters end there. Don't pass the captain america shield to his side kick and the role of iron man to tony starks wife and friend.The sound and music was great. The video effects were awesome. I didn't have a problem with most of the jokes or spoken lines. But the plot holes, pacing, and legacies are what subtracted 4 points for me.",2019-05-02,6,29,3,26,English
988,arcticsummer,"Very disappointing vs. the great Infinity Wars. What happened to all the witty dialogue? The writing was just plain poor this time around. It felt like the writers were lazy and took the audience for granted. Cheap fat jokes just don't cut it in this movie. Instead of the joy we felt watching Infinity Wars (and the first Avengers movie), we felt one big ""meh"" after watching this one. With very few exceptions, the interesting character interplay and humor that was present in Infinity Wars was absent in this one. It's frustrating to see this movie getting such great reviews from ""professional"" reviewers.

991,CamiDontJay,"The Good- There are a couple of clap worthy moments. Hawkeye, Captain America, and Thanos were good in this movie. ........That's all I got.The Bad- My god, so much. The script reminds me of my book reports from elementary school, hurriedly doing it the night before just so I had something to hand in. It appears the same approach was used here. No thought put into it whatsoever as it shows with horrible pacing, lazy dialogue, and the worst plot device to resolve the story (extremely lazy writing). Once powerful characters are reduced to pure comic relief (Thor, Hulk). They can have their comedic moments, but also show they can tear it up when necessary. They decided not to do that in their infinite wisdom. The force fed female/S JW agenda is on full display here having the women be the most powerful characters in the movie.This is done with the subtlety of being smashed over the head with a cinder block. For what is supposed to be the finale of 11years worth of movies, there is virtually no action because who wants to see that in a superhero movie? That took some David Copperfield-level magic to pull that off, but they did (slow clap). Brav-o. The movie also runs for an obscene 3 hours when 2 would have been fine. We needed to see everyone hug in all combinations. Essentially seeing the same scene five times.The emotional scenes miss like me using the toilet in middle of the night due to the phoned in script. This movie has the energy of an 88 year-old woman on a dialysis machine. A lot of low talking and me not caring.The Deal- This movie is as big a disappointment as the Phantom Menance was for me 20 years ago. The studio knew we would watch this movie regardless of what type of crap stew they brewed up. Sadly, had they stuck closer to the source material, this would have been a lot better. But the hack screenwriters thought that something that a high school student could come up would go over........and unfortunately, it did. This movie is all hype. Phase 4 will be an SJW gush-fest as prefaced here. They did not mention one of the stones in the movie......The refund stone.",2019-05-04,0,60,6,54,English

All’s well that ends well except for a philanthropic billionaire in a metallic suit who gives his life in an Armageddon’s Bruce Willis style to save the universe…how original! All the fake emotions and childish humors from the post 2000’s superhero movies are masterfully treasured here as well for the delight of the simple minded. Adding all the enjoyable special effects and the diversity of the superheroes eclipsing the incoherent simplistic plot, and that gives you the most profitable movie of all time.

998,sahlab,"TL;DR: Avengers: Endgame is a massive extravaganza film with a lot of enjoyable moments, but without soul, purpose, artistic vision, philosophy or literary value. It's just a big teaser/commercial for upcoming ""products"" by the Disney;Marvel brand.Final verdict: I'm done with the MCU.The Good: -Moments, plenty of memorable moments, plenty of funny moments. It almost feels like the script had the sole challenge of gluing as many cool moments together while marginally providing a way out of the dead end they wrote themselves into with Infinity War's ending.-RDJ delivers a solid performance, without which I think this movie would be unwatchable.-As per usual, visual effects are great, especially with characters that rely heavily on motion capture, and the de-aging tech is becoming scarily good.-In spite of my harsh criticism of this movie's direction (that is still to come), I still think the Russos deserve praise for taking on the monumental task of handling a comic cross-over event.The Bad:-Writing: Bad writing: bad storytelling, bad character arcs, SJW crap breaking the immersion every few minutes, bad dialogue, lazy jokes and a time-traveling plot that doesn't make any sense. And mother of God, plot convenience is the one true hero of this movie. Scott Lang is saved from being trapped in the Quantum realm by plot convenience mouse, Stark figures out time travel by plot convenience AI, Thanos finds out about the avengers' plan by plot convenience cross-time Nebula, and many many other examples.As for SJW crap, Thor and Hulk has been neutered, and Captain Marvel were shoved in this movie without any vision or purpose.-Direction:The direction was weak; The five year gap in the beginning screws up the pacing and is in my opinion a symbol of the triumph of corporate vision over artistic vision. Since there is no discernible effect of the this 5 year gap on the plot, or even most of the story threads. I can only guess this 5 year gap is a corporate device to house spin-off shows and things of this sort. Something we'll just have to wait and see.The pacing of the movie is terrible all throughout. But specifically, the impact of the heist part is totally undercut by the ""past Nebula revealing the plan to Thanos"" crap, this crap was there only to produce the mandatory final showdown, which wasn't very inspired but had some ""cool"" moments, the plot ends about 15 minutes before the end of the movie which is always a problem.In Infinity War, the directors did a good job of juggling the many characters, but in Endgame, not at all. A good example would be that the only thing BP did in this movie was be on screen for a few seconds and say: ""Yibambe""! Add to that the clear SJW motif of neutering Hulk and Thor, and you get a 3 hour movie that neither develops, nor even build upon the development from past movies, of most key characters.",2019-05-08,4,31,3,28,English
1000,NikolayG,"The biggest problem with Endgame is that it is far too long. Right from the start it has ponderously long scenes. The same story could have been presented in 2 hours without losing a word. Other problems include never learning why Dr. Strange did what he did at the end of Infinity War, a funny but unexplained change to the Hulk, and a major plot device we have already seen in an X-Men movie, a plot device that renders all drama going forward meaningless. Nothing that happens in the next Spider-Man movie, nothing that happens in the upcoming Black Widow movie, matters ... at all. All problems are now, according to what Endgame established, completely fixable after the fact. Finally, Captain Marvel is MUCH too powerful. In one scene (I'll be vague to avoid spoilers) she destroys something very very very large simply by flying through it. If she can do that, none of the other Avengers are really even relevant. Also, I recall that no one but Thor could lift Thor's hammer, so why is Captain America running around with it like it weighs 10 pounds?The good stuff: great scenes with Tony Stark; great scenes with Steve Rogers. In fact, without the personal touches regarding Tony and Steve I would have given this movie a 5. There were a handful of jokes that made the audience roar with laughter but I was in the last row and the jokes were spoken so softly by the characters I couldn't hear what was being said. But I will assume they were great and so list them under the positives.And that's about it. Not spectacular. Though I do give the writers credit for weaving so many characters into the mix (though not enough Black Widow fight scenes for my taste).",2019-04-29,6,21,2,19,English

Some of the character design choices were not well-explained or executed. You are made to accept that 'These well-established character(s) are suddenly different and like this now'.

1015,RottenTomatos,"(RottenTomatoes)- They delete my reviews frequently and the ratings for movies are not as accurate. There time was good, but MetaCritic's time is now. Thank you MetaCritic for not denying people freedom of speech and being corrupt. The 3 hours was unnecessary. First hour is filled with bad jokes and lines that sound like they were written by 5 year old. They spend time on things that don't matter. We want to see Iron man struggle in creating the time machine, we want to see Captain marvel searching to find Iron-man, we want to see Ant-man being abandoned in the void. We don't want to see people eating with hulk at a dinner talking about how they shouldn't give up hope and that the time machine idea is good. Like, seriously way too much time in convincing people to do things that they shouldn't need convincing of or we DID NOT NEED TO SEE. Then Captain america ruined the whole time theory they set up. If he went back in time and married her, then that means there were 2 captain Americas and he somehow stayed in hiding never got recognized. But then also, in a previous movie he banged her child, so presumably that means either she was never born because he married her. OR perhaps that means Captain america always was with her and then that means he **** his own daughter. But still that would mean that there should currently be one old Captain america and a young one. But we only see the old one. There should be two. And the shield was also supposed to go to Bucky.    This project took years and it is just barely not ****. They made the first one good, so they didn't need to try on this one I guess.    The last movie felt like adults wrote the script, but this one seems like it was written by a girl in 8th grade.",2019-04-28,5,24,2,22,English

If they want to go timeTravel to get the stones and if Banner told them If he change something in the past won’t change the future, then why didn’t they get the stones  when Thor injury Thanos in Wakanda battle and all the characters just take the gauntlet with the stones and bring to the Future. That would have make much easier instead going to different timelines to get the stones individually and Black Widow could have been alive. The first half was so boring to do timeHeist.

1061,Boskowitz,"Utterly pointless movie. Replace the last ten minutes of IW with the last ten minutes of Endgame, and you have everything of note in a single movie. Unfortunately a big step back from Infinity War. IF offered an epic plot with the fantastic worlds, that was made great by great characters. EG is emotional and character-based drama. The only problem is, emotions and characters are where EG fails. It is hard to believe those two movies were made by the same people. Bad script, bad direction, bad pretty much everything. Scenes and emotions flow without any regard to each other, scenes of sadness, abruptly replaced by comical ones. A lot of scenes that serve no particular purpose, other than cheap and stupid jokes in what is supposed to be a tragical/drama movie. Or vain effort to convey emotions or shoehorn something in. A man that is able to build a fusion reactor in a cave has to wait for a space taxi? Or that Hawkey/Widow thing. Why is Hawkeye willing to exchange his whole family for Widow? Survivor guilt, yeah, but other than that, why does he want to jump off that cliff? His haircut?Character-wise, I am of course not talking about Brian ""Deus Ex"" Larson, who is just a bad actress playing a bad character in bad scenes. I mean, it is almost funny, she is so OP they have to figure out how to keep her out of the story, because otherwise she would not only marginalise every other hero, but the whole story as well. So bad.Or Black Widow, cold-blooded killer who for some strange reason had a nervous breakdown and now rules the universe while surviving on peanut butter sandwiches. No jelly, that is how serious it is. And the movie is full of such silly and naive scenes one would expect from a college director. Well, it is about time travel after all, but still.It is the disgrace called Thor. Ragnarok/Infinity War completed his awesome story arc, he finished his journey, becomes the high king of the nine worlds (or something).In Infinity War, he had one purpose. To avenge his people and his family. But no! Turns out those 6 movies was not what Thor really wanted. All he really wanted was to tour the universe in a space ship!So instead of leading his people in moments of their greatest needs, he passes the throne onto a traitor and coward and run away to bully a man who lost his mother when he was 5, brought up by pirates and had to kill his own godlike father. Some people find that funny. I guess he was too awesome even for the WOMON POWA, so he had to go. WTF? Thanos Hitlerised into just an another egotistical maniac. Yeah, the reason why IF was so great? An actual antagonist! Constant bullying of Ant-Man was not that funny either. The more I think about it, Endgame is the new low for Marvel Universe. (Not counting Captain Marvel, I mean...) Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 style. Yes, Age of Ultron. I will have to think twice before seeing a Marvel again. The story direction is  completely wrong.",2019-05-04,4,19,1,18,English
1062,abm0,"Nothing much to see here, just a return to the usual Marvel-movie quality level. It's good to see the non-superhero Iron Man finally removed from the picture, with his only power in being a rich guy and owner of advanced technology (and completely unconvincingly portrayed as being smart enough to build or fix said technology himself; kind of the equivalent of that other grossly overrated rich tech guy character we have IRL in a certain Elon Musk), though sadly they did have to turn him into The Great Martyr to get him over with.Really the only impressive Avengers movie in a long time was Infinity War, because it actually did something different and interesting, i.e. killing a lot of superheroes, and introduced a really good, complex villain. Beyond that, all they can do is return to their teen-boy oriented Marvel-as-usual movies.",2019-05-19,6,19,1,18,English

1067,petrovich_zfx,"The most significant problem with this film is it lenght. For such short and simple story it has way too many dialogs and unecesary plot lines. They dull, uninteresting and sometimes senceless. It is just half cooked. Tried to make a grim story, didnt have the guts, cause of children. Tried to step aside from action and show more dramma, wrote very silly lines. It is by all means not a bad movue. It is just simply a borring one. Mediocre.",2019-04-30,5,20,1,19,English

1070,Michael84,"Avengers:Endgame is the culmination of over a decade of work, and while that is admirable (and I have enjoyed it thoroughly for the most part) Endgame felt to me like every one wanted to stand around and part themselves on the back for 3 hours.There were parts of genuine emotion, humor and tragedy, but it really felt like Disney were saying 'Goodbye' to an older product line and 'Hello' to new planks in the franchise building model.I guess we will never know what the Russo brothers could have done if Disney had taken the handcuffs off - they were brilliant in The Winter Soldier - because the movie spent so long establishing new settings and characters for the next phase of the MCU.  New Captain America, Loki disappears with the Tessaract, the Asgardians of the Galaxy, Gentle Hulk ... everywhere you look there is a new movie in the works.  Disney has shown a shocking lack of awareness when it comes to their cash cows - they managed to torpedo the Star Wars franchise after couple of movies - and it looks like they won't be stopping any time soon with the MCU, Black Widow, Gaurdians 3, Spiderman:Far From Home all the works and the feeling of franchise fatigue is well and truly settling in.The movie itself isn't terrible.  It has some really good parts, but it's just kind of a mess.  It flips from tragic, to heroic, to suspense without really knowing if the emotions have landed, or if you even care.  Thor going back and having a moment with his mother is a scene with genuine emotion, then having Hulk and Black Widow barely acknowledge each other in the aftermath of the dusting is completely ridiculous (remember when they were an item? What the hell happened to that? Wouldn't a galaxy spanning tragedy pull the survivors closer together?)  Ugh, it's a series of moments stitched together to create a spectacle but it doesn't really make for a great viewing experience.  Speaking of viewing - did it feel to anyone else that they kind of got to the end of production, saw some of the CGI and went ""Eh, that'll do""?  Because there are scenes that are jarring in the uneven production values of the imagery.  Most scenes are done well, but there is the odd scene where it is really noticeable that they haven't brought their A game.After the initial adrenaline rush of viewing it for the first time, I was struck by how disappointed I felt in the movie.  It had all the elements of a great movie, and yet seemed to be a bit tone deaf in the execution.  And after all the crashing and exploding were finished, the Russo's went full Peter Jackson and spent half an hour at the end giving every character full fan service (complete with nameplate and signatures in the credits).  They should have called the movie Avengers: Curtain Call, and it would have been more appropriate.The one thing it does do is create an end.  Stark sacrificing himself for the greater good sees the full character arc of Tony complete.  He was the first, and most important, Avenger and the MCU won't be the same without him.  (Note: With the introduction of Time travel, it's not like they're just gonna let him stay dead if the box office starts to suffer).So if you're invested in the series, go see it.  It's not for you if you haven't been keeping up with the movies though, as the movie expects you to have a pretty thorough knowledge of the happenings in the MCU up to this point.Welcome to the MCU, where the characters are made up and the plot doesn't matter.",2019-04-30,6,22,1,21,English
1071,Metempsychosis,"One word: ok.First of all, I don't think I've ever seen such a cheap victory for the good guys. Without going into details, the best word I can think of is ""lame"". Thanos seemed like the one that fought the hardest and won because he was the strongest, until the Avengers cheated, and I'm not even talking about the time travel that they invented on the fly. People that saw the movie know what I'm talking about.What the **** was Gamora's motivation? The amount of **** the movie needs to pull so that the Avengers can win is fanfiction worthy.Then there is this grl powah the movies are trying to pull. Here is how you know you're being sexist: invert the genders and if you cringe, you are being sexist. What the hell did they do to Thor? How would that have looked like if they pulled that with Carol?. Why is it funny funny that Gamora did that to Peter? He didn't know it was another Gamora. For ****s sake. It's childish and unnecessary.The good thing is that for every stupid crap the movies pulls, it has something great or heartwarming too. What a great goodbye this movie was. Just not on the same level as Infinity War. But a good watch.",2019-05-05,6,23,1,22,English

1078,TVJerry,"When last we were with this group, Thanos made half of the universe vaporize, including numerous superheroes. This highly-anticipated follow-up (and conclusion to 22 films) is not the typical action-packed adventure. It takes 2 hours (yes, it's 3 hours long) before the big battle begins and it's nothing special in terms of staging, design or effects. For the first 2 hours, the group of leftover Avengers works to figure how to right the last film's devastating destruction. If you're invested in this universe, their conflicts and quests are interesting (with a lighter sprinkling of humor than usual). If not, you'll be scratching your heads trying to piece it all together. Otherwise, it's more a conclusion (with a few inevitable farewells) than an exciting addition to the genre.",2019-05-07,6,17,0,17,English

1080,slippery,"I found the first 75% of this movie to be some of the best and most poignant writing in the Marvel movies.  While some might have found it slow, I found it emotionally deep.However, it kinda felt like, near the end, that they abandoned the plot and just said ""Let's have a giant, epic battle"".And it really doesn't matter that they define their ""time travel"" as ""not Back to the Future"" because they ultimately disregard their own rules on time travel anyway.No matter how you turn it or look at it, one way or the other, their actions at the end of the movie don't make sense.Either what you do in the past is important, or it's not.  It creates alternate timelines, or it doesn't.  You just can't have it both ways.So while I liked the first 3/4 of the movie, the ending was just the same old Hollywood tripe meant to appeal to certain kinds of people.And I guess, looking at the reviews:  they succeeded there.",2019-05-06,4,18,0,18,English
1081,ScienceAdvisor,"Typical time travel plot holes only really effect the ending to a small degree, but the rest of the movie is mostly just fan-service instead of actual plot development.  Many other plot holes ranging from the tiny and momentary, such as Captain Marvel talking in space without comms (no atmosphere, no sound) just like these writers did with Thor in the previous movie, to claiming that the infinity gauntlet cannot do certain things which is oxymoronic, is just more of the same rushed writing we saw from the Russo's in Infinity War.  I particularly liked how nonchalantly the Iron Man glove becomes an infinity gauntlet, because nanites are as good as the magical forge that is driven by a Neutron Star.  But hey, CGI!  Even Rocket's quips were bland and unfunny.  The performances are great, the sound and cinemtatics are great, but the illogical plot points just make this a watch once and forget movie instead of the amazing climax to an era.  This drags down the enjoyment considerably.Without spoiling anything since we know the heros win (Spiderman: Far From Home)- The largest plot hole is what happens to all the people that moved on with their lives?  That ending cannot possibly be considered a good solution.  What about children that had no parents for all that time?  Now add in all the degredation to the world that the Russo's clearly show.  Then factor in that many of these people do not have homes, or bank accounts, or jobs.  The end result is slightly better than the start of the movie, but not by much.  Now the returned have to try to reinegrate... somehow.  But hey, CGI!",2019-05-09,5,22,0,22,English

I still think they should have focused on Scarlet Witch.Those were the points that made the movie average for an MCU movie. However, to be fair, the ending was great. The way they dealt with Ironman and Captain America probably couldn't have been done better. The story line was also great in general.Having said that, I should note that by moving to this political correctness agenda or whatever they want to call it, it is definitely the last MCU movie I will watch in the Cinema.",2019-05-21,6,21,0,21,English

There are a lot things done wrong with End Game and because of the below I gave it a 4/10:- Thor and Hulk put aside for no reason. They tried to make them some kind of funny characters, but it did not work.- Plot holes, plot holes everywhere. Just for example:(ultimate sacrafice for the soulstone - Hawkey lost his family already; time travel; Ant-Man rescued by rat; Thor took Mjolnir to his timeline; Nebula did not travel back in time, but stayed on the ship and got caught instead; Thor almost killed Thanos when he had the gauntlet with all stones and could not beat him without it; Tony takes all stones away from Thanos, just like that). There are many more, but those are the major ones.- weak, dull and unnecessary jokes - pace and narration problems. It felt somethimes like there was a struggle betwwen two concepts and both ideas were implemented.- forced and unnecessary ""strong independent women to the rescue with Spiderman"" sceneFor me a Marvel fan it is a huge disappointment, especially after such good Infinity War.
